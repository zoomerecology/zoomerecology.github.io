I"Î<p>Why are asian Americans so middle class? And why is the middle class so obsessed with asian, asian culture, food and yellow fever?</p>

<p>I suspect that asian Americans, by which you mean northeast asian Americans, I assume, are very middle class because they are high in the characteristics that predict socioeconomic status, that is to say, intelligence, conscientiousness and, to a very limited degree, agreeableness. Also, thereâ€™s elements of neuroticism that predict doing well at university. There was a study on this, an optimum slightly high level of anxiety, this is not like having posttraumatic stress disorder, that predicts doing well in a university. Itâ€™s anxiety as act as a motivator. Anyway, they have all these things, and so you would expect them to do very well in a white society where the average iq is five points lower than theirs, and where white people are going to be less conscientious, less agreeable and less socially anxious than them.</p>

<p>The second part of the question, with regard to why are middle class people, by which I ask you, I mean white middle class people, by the way, this middle class in the english sense, or the american sense, because I understand that middle class is used in America to mean working class. But if we mean the english understanding of middle class, in the middle, so obsessed with asian, asian culture. Iâ€™m not aware that they are.</p>

<p>Asians will tend towards middleclass values, because theyâ€™re a sort of model minority. This is a term thatâ€™s bandied around in sociological literature a lot, and that basically means a minority group that has assimilated to, essentially white cultural norms. And the the reason this has happened is, of course, because this particular group is very these this is a group which is highlyâ€¦, itâ€™s sort of industrious and has high mean ability, the sort of thing. So theyâ€™re going to tend to succeed when they yeah. But they have higher incomes, for example, than whites do an average slightly higher income level. I believe thatâ€™s what I said. But if we could turn to the american dimension of the question.</p>

<p>Why are white middleclass people obsessed with asian culture? Iâ€™ve seen, I mean, iâ€™ve certainly seen indications that they are, theyâ€™re very interested in sort of japanese culture. So there is a certain sort of interest that white American, particularly younger males, have in that particular culture.</p>

<p>Why would that be? Would that be? Because would that be because we are inculcated with this multiculturalism dogma that says that we should be interested in foreign cultures, and that culture is a from the east, which we somehow inherently find mesmerizing and mysterious and attractive and be a high intelligence culture. And we are archaic culture or something, and we are that, and so therefore weâ€™re somehow more attracted to it. Or or could it be that they just Fancy east asian girls, and therefore interested in their culture because they want to get in their pants?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an interesting question. I donâ€™t honestly know what the appeal is, but there is a definite interest in asian culture within, the white middle classes.</p>

<p>And he talks about the food. I mean, thatâ€™s the interesting thing. I itâ€™s just a personal observation, but in England, youâ€™re either into indian food or youâ€™re into chinese food. Thereâ€™s very much a divide. And my experience is that the more violently middle class a family is, the more likely they are to get chinese takeaways rather than indian ones. Or Thai. They all seem to like thai food, these snobs.</p>

<p>Subtlety of tastes, uh? People that have high iq and whatever, they tend to, they have greater color acuity. So presumably they have more subtle sense of taste, and therefore they prefer chinese food or something to indian food. Cleverer people will have greater color acuity. Clever are people with more middle class, clever people will prefer chinese food. That was my oh, right. Okay, right. So that sort of variegation of flavors, that sort of subtlety of flavors.</p>

<p>Whereas people with low, low ability are going to like bland food more. No! they not like strong food because they canâ€™t appreciate subtle flavors. Theyâ€™re like strong flavors.</p>
