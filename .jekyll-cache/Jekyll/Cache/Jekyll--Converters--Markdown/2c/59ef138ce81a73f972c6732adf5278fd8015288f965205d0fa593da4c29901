I"(<p>Are you familiar with behavioral stink? Yes we are. Do you think multiculturalism and acceptance of homosexuality is a behavioral sink? Multiculturalism, I should think so.</p>

<p>Yes. We’ve looked at this in in some detail with the social epistasis model and the idea of spiteful mutations, and how they negatively impact even though don’t carry the mutation, They imbue them with an idea that they should do maladaptive things. And this all spreads. And so, yes, the answer is yes. Do you need to add to that?</p>

<p>Okay, so so basically, the, uh, the issue of a behavioral sync is, it’s a very behavioristic term. So we have this idea that there are maladaptive feedback cycles of behavior that lead to a sort of, people moving in the behavioral landscape towards certain, you know, certain troughs, essentially. And they get trapped in these troughs. The problem with the behavioral sync model is it’s not sort of, genetically or epigenetically informed. And we can improve on it. With social epistasis. Because what we have with social epistasis, or social epistasis amplification model, is more of a kind of mutational sink, more so than the behavioral sink. And what, what couldn’t happen is that the presence of certain kinds of as usual carriers of spiteful mutants, particularly those in a position to normalize certain behaviors, you you might get a situation which that creates a sort of strange attractor condition, which draws people in, creates a sort of local optima for these novel, these these neomorphs behave neomorphs of behavior. And this leads to, you know, this leads to the whole Culhoun eventual collapse, essentially. So that’s, that’s my, that’s my take on it. Perhaps we should rename it the epigenetic stink, or mutational sync or something. We need to give it a better term.</p>
