I")<p>Has Asia altered its gene pool by eliminating large swathes of individuals with moderately low agreeableness? If so, then how long might the effect last?</p>

<p>I’ll tell you how. It’s actually a very good question. Um, ron nuns wrote about this in a thesis, bachelor’s sort of honors thesis, that he wrote when he was at Harvard under E.O. Wilson back in the 1980s. He’s one of the first people to sort of discuss culture gene coevolution. And the thesis was eventually published, believe it or not, as an article in the american conservative. This is one of the articles that led to him being purged from a magazine by the various, sort of, ex shia that had accumulated around this magazine after he he founded it.</p>

<p>But the the argument he made was that, basically, if you look historically at China in particular, you can see periods where you have these emperors who are quite vicious in terms of persecuting individuals who didn’t think precisely like they did on sundry questions. And they had this period in their history called, I think, 100 schools period or something. It was a period of great upheaval problems, and it ultimately resulted in the dominance of the of the confucian ideology and the almost complete destruction of the sort of taoist tendency in China. This, he argued, represented a major culture gene coevolution event in which essentially a chinese ruling class destroyed everyone who wasn’t like them, and meant that the subsequent generation would resemble them by default, right, because they’re the only ones left having any children.</p>

<p>Also, he argues, this process might have continued up until Mau, certainly continued into the 50s, even with the cultural revolution.</p>

<p>Also, the chinese emperors did tend to have a lot of children. They tend to have numerous wives and concubines. And the concubines would be rotated according to their place in the menstrual cycle. They understood such thing. It’s the same with with Mao Zedong. He retained that tradition. Indeed, when I was an undergraduate, I knew someone who now works on burn scanning studies, who claimed to be a niece of Mau Sedong and a product of, uh, sort of, who related to mau through a mother or something, and had tons and tons of cousins because of this process.</p>

<p>Well, I think Marx once said of the Chinese that they are sort of stuck in these cycles of despotism. And I think what Marx missed was the fact that these cycles of despotism will have a miserable effect on the genomes of these populations by the culture gene coevolution. So essentially, the despots presumably breed more despots, thus perpetuating the cycle, which would certainly explain why China’s going the way it’s going at the moment.</p>

<p>They don’t have much of a questioning class, do they? I mean, I think it’s extraordinary, from what i’ve no, I’m never going to go to China. If I were to go to a country that was chinese, i’d go to Taiwan. Presumably Taiwan is relatively safe and and one can, one can trust the situation. But I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t go to China.</p>
