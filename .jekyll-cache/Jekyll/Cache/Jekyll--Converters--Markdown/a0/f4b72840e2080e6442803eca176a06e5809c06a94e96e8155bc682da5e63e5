<p>Talk about flexibility and monumentalism, then it’s relationship to Iq and personality.</p>

<p>Okay. Well, these concepts of flex humility and, uh, monumentalism were developed in the crosscultural psychology literature. So basically, monumentalism is the idea of finding meaning in life, right? So people who live in very monumentalist type cultures, they see existential meaning in everything, through religion, through being being sort of very motivated towards higher purposes.</p>

<p>Minkow, that’s right. It’s minkov, uh, the crosscultural psychologist who did all this stuff in the 2011 paper.</p>

<p>And, uh, flexumility is the opposite. Flexumility is is more a kind of, it’s more like, your selfinterest, nihilistic personoriented, you know, selfactualizing, postmodern, postmaterialist type values, the sort of things that wetzel and engelhart Call postmaterialism, right? So it’s more into that. And it turns out that it’s really a very key dimension in in terms of modernized societies. Because where you have high levels of modern modernization, you always have low levels of monumentalism and high levels of flex humility.</p>

<p>And it’s been found, actually, minkoff did some studies, I think was it oishi and Dinar. I forget which, which group it was, but they were testing Martin Varushek’s claim that suicide rates were strongly predicted between countries by Iq. And what they did is they actually found that when you control from the monumentalism flexibility axis, I keep just dropped out of the model and didn’t predict anything anymore. So Iq is highly collinear with flexumility. And, uh, it turns out that is the flexumility that’s causing the high levels of suicide among developed nations relative to less developed nations, not the high iq.</p>

<p>So it seems that nations which have high levels of flexumility tend towards all these, you know, these modernistic type values and atheism and sort of selfinterest, selfworship, rather than sort of being community focused and communityoriented. And they become obsessed with all of these higher, sort of moral callings, which always revolve around individualized, as opposed to high binding forms of morality. So things like fairness and, equality preferences Read Minkov’s 2011 paper on the subject. It was really very, very good, actually.</p>

<p>Actually, i’ll just add to this, monumentalists societies are further highly cohesive, I’m reading from the monograph here, especially familial level, and exhibit low suicide rates. In fact, monumentalism is currently the best single predictor of national suicide rates, with which it strongly negatively.</p>
