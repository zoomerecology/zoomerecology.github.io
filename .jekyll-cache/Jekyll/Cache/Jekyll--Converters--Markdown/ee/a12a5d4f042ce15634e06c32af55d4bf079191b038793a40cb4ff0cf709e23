I"±º<p>Thereâ€™s a kind of a glorious cluster of things which are happening, each of which would seem to affect intelligence in a slightly different way. And I think to really start this, we have to draw a distinction between, two effects. One is the longterm decline in general intelligence, which has been noted in the literature. There was a metaanalysis of working memory which was published by the one gupparaj group in intelligence. They found longterm declines in working memory performance on two different measures. Thereâ€™s the Jacob Peachnick work on each Negan Gitla, on threedimensional rotational ability, the same trend on vocabulary items, etc. So these longterm trends, which Charles Murray termed, the woodley effect.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re getting worse from color discrimination. Okay, so weâ€™ll do the list. So simple reaction time. Yup. Theyâ€™re both visual and auditory, because we have it on both in two countries, in the Uk. And Sweden. Working memory, two measures. So we have it on corsi blocks, and we have it on the measure of the backwoods digit span. We have it on color discrimination ability, a paper based on a prediction that if reaction times were slowing, other psychomotor skills and perceptual faculties should also be showing similar declines which looked at all these normalization studies.</p>

<p>So people today are less able to discriminate or notice very fine differences between hue in tiles. The idea is that you have to arrange for tiles in sort of order of hue, so going from most green at one end to, say, most purple at the other, and you have every color in between, and you have to arrange them. And you make these errors, right? Where you you get the wrong hue in the wrong place. Itâ€™s like a sort of a jigsaw almost you have to solve. Itâ€™s called the farnsworth muscle q test. And I got hold of all of the standardization samples from western countries, where this had been normalized essentially against the population norm. And what I found was that thereâ€™s been actually a very significant decline in color discrimination ability, or hue discrimination ability, which is sort of consistent, really, with the whole Gaulton theme, you know, the idea that intelligence is best captured by these basic sort of sensory and neurological properties. Um. So it ties in nicely with the simple reaction time findings as well.</p>

<p>The first normalization of color discrimination was in the 1940s, although it used an oldfashioned method. So the earliest current normalization that we have comes from the 1970s. So our data span from the 1970s to the 2010s. But the test was developed in the 1940s by farnsworth and munsell, after whom the test, the main test is named. There are other tests as well.</p>

<p>For a long time people didnâ€™t realize that this actually correlated of Iq. It correlates with iq quite well. So well, in fact, that it turns out that if you make a latent variable out of different sensory discrimination modalities, so, say, pitch discrimination, color discrimination, you know, weight discrimination, so the ability to sort of pick up two weights and work out which one is is heavier, that sort of thing, you know, these physical quantity tests, and you make a general factor out of these, it turns out that general factor is identical to the general factor that you extract from psychometric tests. Itâ€™s the same g and in some studies, the correlation between these two g factors, the sort of general factor of sensory discrimination ability in the general factor of intelligence, is perfect. So itâ€™s a very good measure then, of g.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a phenomenal measure when you have more than one of them. So when you have lots and lots and lots of them and you make a variable, youâ€™ve got, youâ€™ve got a measure of g, but itâ€™s as good as the gâ€™s you get from pencil and paper tests, which suffers from none of the drawbacks of those Gâ€™s, like the flynn effect. Because we know that no flynn effect on color discrimination. Itâ€™s a woodley effect. It might well be that there are woodley effects on other of these sensory discrimination measures as well. You could go out and collect norms of, say, pitch discrimination. Seems obvious. We could do the same thing. We could see if thereâ€™s been a decline, and I predict there will have been. So a big g factor among these sensory discrimination tasks.</p>

<p>People are getting worse at singing. And inevitably, our environmentalist friends will say, itâ€™s because they donâ€™t go to church anymore. They donâ€™t practice hymns. They can say that, but they have to prove it. And the simplest explanation is that these trends relate to a common process, and that process is genetic change within the population due to the action of selection favoring the fertility of those with lower levels of G as opposed to higher levels of G.</p>

<p>And we also looked a number of other measures. Thereâ€™s the ability to count backwards, creativity, thatâ€™s a working memory measure. Weâ€™ve now got that on two working memory measures and a really, really bigâ€¦ Itâ€™s quite funny story actually. I published a reanalysis of a study in intelligence which claimed that there were no secular trends on shortterm memory and, longterm working memory, measured using the digit span forwards for shortterm memory and digit span backwards tests for working memory, rather. And what I did is I broke the data into two did a weighted regression and found, well, sure enough, thereâ€™s a flynn effect on the short term memory. Itâ€™s going up. So thatâ€™s our ability to measure more bits of information and remember more bits of information. If you think about it. This makes sense. People have to remember passwords, and we have to remember things like, um, telephone numbers, etc. So, you know, our capacity, our short term memory capacity, should be increasing, working memory decreasing.</p>

<p>So you get this perfect in the same sample, among the same individuals, the short term memory is increasing in the same individuals, for working memory is decreasing. So you have flynn and woodley. Is like splitting the phenomenological atom. The let the specialized ability, goes up, the g goes down. And itâ€™s a perfect split. The woodley effect that got the most attention was the reaction times.</p>

<p>Going back to the digits spans. I was given help for publishing this paper when James Thompson blogged about it. And there were all sorts of very aggressive comments, people saying, no, youâ€™ve used the wrong metaanalytic waiting, and your effect is bogus, and you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing. You know, go back to school or whatever. So well, Lo and Behold, a year later, a group led by a guy called piro on Gupparaj is a very brilliant student over at kingâ€™s college London did a metaanalysis of every single study of Shortterm memory and working memory ever conducted. And guess what? They found exactly what I showed in my paper, except using a sample size of over 150 000 people. And they used two measures of working memory and two measures of shortterm memory. And they found that the two measures of shortterm memory were showing the flynn effect, the two measures of working memory were showing the socalled woodley effect.</p>

<p>The thing that got the most attention there was the Victorians were smart from us, that the reaction times, at least the golden oldie. The original version of that paper was very flawed. One of the big problems, we were actually, quite rightly taken to task for this by two very very capable, reaction time researchers who knew a lot more about reaction times than I did, Yulia and Yuri Dodenov, a russian husband and wife team. And they wrote a very, very long response to our paper, which was very instructive. And they pointed out all of these problems with comparing between these different studies. And what we did is we took all of their suggestions and all of their corrections for method variants and things, and try to make the studies more comparable. So weâ€™re comparing apples with apples instead of apples of oranges. And we actually found it made the trend stronger. Itâ€™s quite interesting actually, if you look at the original, if you look at the original graph, it looks like a shotgun has gone off. You have golden study down here, and you have this, like smattering of other studies all around here, with this huge variance and huge amount of heterogeneity. When we finish correcting the studies and sort of close matching them for, you know, by on biocultural basis, what we found was that they, you ended up with this regression line where everything happened the regression line really nicely.</p>

<p>And yes, the estimated Iq loss inferred on that basis decreased, but it decreased to a, it decreased by only a couple of Iq points. So it dropped to around, letâ€™s say, 10 Iq points a day, 10, 10 Iq points a century, rather than, I think it was 14 or something before. It was quite high. Originally it was nearly a standard deviation. Itâ€™s too high, right? Okay, so 10 points. I mean, even so thatâ€™s still, thatâ€™s the difference between a, I donâ€™t know, a standard architechor top scientist. Itâ€™s still got the woodley effect</p>

<p>So Gaulton, it was a huge study conducted in the science museum by allison, a very big replication of Gaulton study. It replicated everything, virtually everything about gold and study, the location, the sort of demographics it was sampling from, even the presence of a participation fee that people had to pay. Because back in the 80s, you might not, well, you might remember this. Back in the 80s, one had to actually pay a small fee to enter the science museum in London. Itâ€™s now free. So that simulated the fee that Dalton was collecting from his participants, I think. Yeah. So itâ€™s a perfect sort of matching of the sample of golden sample. And then we have these others from the scottish, uh lothian cohorts. So itâ€™s all twenty year seven cohorts. You never did two, two or three of these Ian Deary studies, large studies. We had four studies in total. Yeah, that showed one that should one point a decade decline. So this is just from the Uk.</p>

<p>This is then the evidence for the, for the woodley effect, the decline in G. And the key factors, which are causing it. Well, the first is simply the consequences of contraception. So the the issue here is that once contraception was developed, it was taken up by the reading classes, by the the more intelligent people, basically. And itâ€™s used, kind of trickled down society. The ability to use contraception is predicted by intelligence. Because do you just did you just have sex impulsively? If so, you have low intelligence? Or do you not use it properly? Or do you use it properly? Do you plan? So contraception becomes the big factor. Because large families, that increasingly become a matter when child mortality isnâ€™t really going on a doors about one percent, large families become basically a matter of chance and of error and of people not being intelligent, with people having them by accident, basically. And so consequently, theyâ€™re associated with low iq. And thereâ€™s now this, what is it, minus 0.1, correlation between fertility and intelligence.</p>

<p>Now my colleague, Michael Heaney, um, Charlie reeve, and I published a metaanalysis of this, because nobody had actually bothered to metaanalyze the correlation between iq and fertility, which was kind of odd, because, you youâ€™d have thought that itâ€™s a particularly sociologically significant thing. And it really ought to be the case that we collect together all the studies and find out what the overall effect is and look at other properties. So we published a study last year. We were actually amazed that we were the first people to do this. Literally, no one had bothered to do this before. And what we found was that, overall, a very, very, very large sample, because itâ€™s metaanalysis, youâ€™re taking all these other studies and pooling them, essentially, we found the correlations -0.11, for male and moving together, and for women itâ€™s significantly bigger. We found a model, we used a thing called a moderator analysis. And in metaanalysis, a moderator analysis is a way of estimating the degree to which a factor predicts some variation within the metaanalysis. So we look at sex, and we see if splitting the metaanalytics subsamples into male and female and comparing the two effect sizes, does categorizing those things based on dimorphic sex, does that actually, lead to some kind of significant indicator of moderation? The answer is, yes, it does, because females have higher rates of dysgenics than males do.</p>

<p>However, youâ€™ve got to remember, it doesnâ€™t really matter what the female number is or what the male number is, because ultimately, the offspring, youâ€™re going to have the iq that is a function of the average of their parents.</p>

<p>What was it for the women though? One of the reasons that the, the correlation is, um, the negative is high among women is, of course, probably feminism. And that is, thatâ€™s the second fact we look at in the book, which is that in modern times women are educated women, you know, go to college or whatever. The less intelligent women, she drops out of college, which also have scores, sheâ€™s about 16 or whatever, she gets pregnant by a series of unsuitable men. Goes on welfare or whatever. And she is becoming, sheâ€™s perhaps a grandmother at the age of 38. By the time her more intelligent contemporary is looking into becoming a mother, and that more intelligent contemporary will have dedicated the whole of her twenties, and, increasingly, even the first half of her thirties, to her career. And then sheâ€™ll have some one or two children, or maybe sheâ€™ll find itâ€™s too late and she canâ€™t have any, and she adopts, or something like that. There was a study that found the highest Iq band of women tend not to have any children at all. Theyâ€™re interested in ideas.</p>

<p>He wasnâ€™t the first person to know. Itâ€™s just one that, itâ€™s just, itâ€™s one of, one of the more stunning demonstrations of this actually comes from, now, I canâ€™t remember the original source, but it was reported in Dean Keith Simmons 2003 book, chapter on, uh, genius, in which he looked at the fertility and demographic corollaries of genius. And thereâ€™s this sort of claim thatâ€™s made that geniuses tend to die childless. And itâ€™s true, they have massive subreplacement fertility. He actually did a profile, he profiled these historiometrically eminent individuals, and found that they were generally childless as a rule of thumb, or the fertility rates they had were extremely low. If they had children, it was, you know, one, maybe, something like that. But the interesting, the interesting, there were exceptions, of course, like Darwin, who had multiple children, many of whom died, incidentally, because, because of the inbreeding depression, he married his cousin.</p>

<p>But the interesting thing about these geniuses is one of the sort of remarks he makes in the book about high functioning people and low fertility. He references a paper which looked at the fertility among female graduates of the Stanford Law School. So these are going to be the top lawyers in the country. These are going to be people who are going to go on and, you know, theyâ€™re going to dominate the top law firms, Et cetera. Heâ€™s going to be the top of the top of the top. So these women are going to be like their male counterparts, insanely highly selected for intelligence. If he found, I think he found several years of graduates, and I might be mischaracterizing the study slightly, so donâ€™t take this as gospel. Do look up the study. I believe he looked across several years worth of graduates and found something like one child or something, and that was about, that was, yeah, that was among, I think, all of the female graduates of the Stanford Law School. It was an iq shredder, as Nick Land would say, you know, it just basically just destroys their fertility. They just, education has this very pronounced effect on female fertility. And speaking to this in terms of numbers again, because I promised you numbers. There is a significant moderation effect of sex, exactly as I said. The qb value is 596. Itâ€™s statistically significant at alpha probability value of 0.05. That means we have a sample of 29 studies, 14 effect sizes for just women, 15 for men. Among the 14 just females, the the Iq fertility correlations -0.13. Okay, so itâ€™s 0.2 more than the average average. Now, for men itâ€™s -0.06. Oh right. So the difference is is substantial between men and women. Yeah.</p>

<p>And I have seen studies including the ncds, which is a big british prospective longitudinal cohort study, which is a huge, wonderful crosssectional study of all these babies born in a threeweek period in 1958 across the United Kingdom. Itâ€™s really, I published several studies using this data set. In that data set, the correlation between iq and fertility among men is positive, at positive, I think, 0.4. And also in Sweden, there was a paper looking at military conscript data that found positive correlations between iq and fertility, just among the males. And iâ€™ve seen this in the in the Us as well, on the more highly g loaded from finland from the 70s, which found that as well. Yeah, but this is just for men, you see? Iâ€™m assuming itâ€™s to do with women sexually selecting for stages or something like that. Well, in the men, itâ€™s interesting because it seems that, all else being equal dysgenic fertility is very, very small in males overall. Itâ€™s present 0.6.</p>

<p>The reason for this is quite interesting. it is to do a disassortative mating. So assortative mating is is the idea that people will make based on similarity. However, women are also hypergamous. Theyâ€™re more choosy about traits. They look foreign. They look for males of higher status. So if you have a lot of women in very, very high status environments, such as universe elite universities, or or law schools, right? Theyâ€™re not going to find males of higher status because theyâ€™re going to be at the top of their game. So as a consequence of that theyâ€™re not going to pick males. Theyâ€™re going to price themselves out of the mating market, right? Which means they, they then run the risk of of becoming childless. So males of equivalent iq however, are not so picky, and they have higher rates of fertility. When you match Iqs women, like use of over 130, with men with like use of over 130, the males are far more female, far more fertile than their female counterparts. And the reason for this is because the males are willing to make down. They will be less choosy picking females, or the ones who are lower down and are meeting up. Right? Now, in that way, they tend to make it so the males will make down, the lower ability women will mate up, the higher ability women canâ€™t mate up because thereâ€™s no higher level. Thereâ€™s a consequence, they price themselves out of the amazing market. And what this does is it creates a stronger negative correlation between iq and fertility for women.</p>

<p>In the wake of World War one, the generation born in the 1880s and 1890s, there was some 16 percent, eight percent of the men were killed in World War one in english man, but it was 16 of the officers. And this helped to worsen an already quite bad spinster crisis among upper middle class women, which was that there just were way more upper middleclass girls, and there were men to marry them. And of course, theyâ€™d rather die than marry down and so and so thatâ€™s right. The curse of hypergamy. So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re basically seeing again. These highly educated women like, these female historians who get on telly. Iâ€™ve seen one of them complaining recently about this, canâ€™t find a man. Sheâ€™s 38. Itâ€™s going to freeze her eggs. But thereâ€™s all of the really high status men have gone. And so thereâ€™s a degree to which itâ€™s almost like weâ€™ve created polygamy again. What can she do to satisfy herself? Or she can have affairs with highstakes men, perhaps, or something like that, but sheâ€™s not going to get one.</p>

<p>The other important factor is the age at first birth, or rather, age of median birth. And this is a very interesting thing, because it cuts to a particularly controversial claim that I have made in the literature, that the iq, the g decline, is on the order of one iq point per decade. And a lot of people have said, like gregory cochrane for example, said, oh, woodleyâ€™s insane. How can that possibly be? The breeders equation shows that at most, the Iq loss should be on the order of, what, a third of a point a decade or something. So thatâ€™s about one point a generation. And Iâ€™m saying, no, itâ€™s about three points a generation. Itâ€™s about one point a decade. And thereâ€™s two reasons why I say that. One is thatâ€™s what the data actually indicate. You convert these iq declines and these color discrimination ability declines and these other things, and you sort of an average across these woodley effects, the decline comes out at about one point per decade, roughly. So in terms of data, Iâ€™m right.</p>

<p>But in terms of how this might be, we need to look at an additional factor, that is a that is at play in socalled dysgenic fertility patterns. And some of you are familiar with the breeders equation. So this is an old equation developed by fisher in the 1920s, and itâ€™s based on a very simple mathematical relationship. And that is that basically, the responsiveness of any given trait to any given degree of selection pressure is proportional to the heritability of that trait. So in other words, the way you make a trait change more quickly over generations is by varying one of two parameters. You either change the strength of selection for a fixed unit of heredity, or you change the level of heredity for a fixed unit of selection. And it turns out that iq, we know, has a heritability of approximately 0.78, something like that. And we know how to calculate the selection pressure acting on Iq. All you have to do is take the iq of the parents, and then you take the weighted iq of the parents, where you weight each parent by the number of children, and you take the difference between the two, and youâ€™ve got your your selection strength. And then you multiply that by the heritability, and, hey, presto, youâ€™ve got yourself a responsiveness to selection. And yes, if you do that with Iq Data, using that very simple formula, you tend to get about a third of an Iq pointed a decade, or a one iq point per generation, roughly.</p>

<p>So why am I saying that the numbers are bigger? Well, it turns out that thereâ€™s another factor going on, and thatâ€™s that itâ€™s not about the number of offspring that you produce. Itâ€™s about the number of descendants that you leave. And you alluded to earlier, oftentimes when you have these low ability people who have children in their teens, they can become grandparents before the highest ability people have even started to have fertility. So what this means in practice is that the breeders equation is misleading. Because the breederâ€™s equation is only telling you about the next generation. Whatâ€™s happening in reality is, in addition to the next generation, a large chunk of the population will have produced an additional generation, what geneticists would call an f2 generation, right? You have parental generation, the f1 generation, which is the offspring, and the f2 generation, which is the grandchildren. So if you use a slightly different model which takes into account the agent median birth, in addition to the strength of selection, what you actually find is two very interesting things. One, that most of the heavy lifting in terms of dysgenic pressure comes not from the gradient of selection, but from the interaction between the gradient of selection and the age at first birth. And itâ€™s actually a differential age at first birth, which in some cases, like in the case of Augustine Kongâ€™s icelandic study, where he built this huge multigenerational linkage model, where he had and the descendants and all sorts of things. His model showed that, you showed that most of the heavy lifting was being done by the differential turnover of generations as a function of different levels of iq and educational attainment, rather than nearly the fertility gradient. And what he also found was that the formula that he devised, when you substitute his heritability value for iq, and he put in a value of 0.3, because heâ€™s being very conservative, so he put a very, very low estimate of the additive heritability of Iq to correct for whatâ€™s called the missing heritability, because his model was based on polygenic scores. So you had to adjust the missing heritability. What he did in his formula, he had to correct for missing heritability, excuse, using actual polygenic scores. He was using genetic variance sampled from a hundred thousand people in iceland to work out this, to determine the presence of this dysgenic pressure on these populations. And what he found was that, yes, if you use a small, low end estimate of the heritability of Iq, ie 0.3, as your super duper conservative sort of estimate, then, yes, you end up with an iq loss of about 0.3 of an iq point per decade. So, so one per generation. So far, so good, right? It looks like Kong is is saying essentially what everybody else is saying with the breeders equation. However, not so fast. Because we know that the we know that in reality, the additive heritability of Iq is not 0.3. Based on twin studies, itâ€™s around 0.7. And if you isolate g and estimate its heritability, independently of all the nong variants in Iq tests, the heritability jumps up to 0.86. So in other words, it goes up to nearly 0.9. So if you start putting in these higher values, you start getting values out of Kongâ€™s model which are close to the values that we got with the reaction times, 0.8 per decade lost, 0.9 of a point per decade. Um, yes. So he was wrong, basically.</p>

<p>The other factor which we looked at in the book was welfare. And there was some very interesting, research on this by uh, in a book called the welfare trait, by a child called Adam perkins. And he was, he showed, it was a research he drew upon, he showed that if you divide the society into those, into three three groups, those where both parents are on welfare, I the least intelligent. Those were one parents on welfare. And those where neither are, I the most intelligent. Only the ones that are, where both parents are on welfare, have above replacement fertility. So itâ€™s possible, therefore, that welfare is another factor in this interlock into this, into this interrelated group of factors thatâ€™s relevant. Because if you go back to the 40s or whatever, welfare was just enough to live off. It certainly wasnâ€™t lifestyle choice. I mean, it was just enough to it was, you were impoverished. If you were on welfare before that, it was even worse. You were in the work house. And nobody wanted to go to the workhouse. And so nobody would deliberately have children on welfare. And it was quite possible that if you did, theyâ€™d end up being taken away because you wouldnâ€™t be able to afford to look after them. And now, of course, the welfare is so generous that these families get, all these mothers get they get income support per child. They get child benefit, which is quite more than you need. They didnâ€™t, of course, spend that on their children. They spend it on Hifi and tattoos and, and the children kind of eat crisps. This is perhaps another factor. Another factor is possibly, of course, immigration because we have immigrant immigration now from developing countries, the average iq is lower. And it was our colleague, emil, who looked at the danish military draft data, or whatever it was. And he found that the average iq of the danes is set at 100, then that of the new danes, as theyâ€™re known is 85. Now, one of the complex areas, this is the woodley effect, then, so far and the decline in general intelligence.</p>

<p>One of the areas that complicates it is the is the flynn effect. The flynn effect is simply an increase of around three iq points per decade in uh on performance on socalled pencil and paper type Iq tests. Now, this is an average across a whole bunch of different tests. Some tests produce very little in the way of flint effects. Some tests are very sensitive to the flynn effect, but by and large, these sort of written problemsolving type tests tend to be quite sensitive to this. The ravens test is very sensitive to it. You get iq gains from the order of seven points per decade. There that those have been noted in in South Korea, which underwent very rapid modernization in the 80s, and the Iq scores just went so basically, this effect is named after Jim Flynn. However, he was not the first person to detect it. The earliest detection was runquist in the 1930s. And runquist sort of noted offhandedly that when he looked at some old Iq data of his and compared it to some new data 10 years later, roughly the same sample, but the iq had increased. Thereâ€™s another chap, sort of contemporary of his, 10 years later, noticed the same thing, guy called Tottenham, and so on and so forth. This effect was actually noticed quite frequently by people, so much so that in the 1960s, it was used as a way of sort of discrediting claims about dysgenics. And this led to the coining of the thing called Cattellâ€™s paradox. Because himself set up these huge samples in the in the 1930s, and then revisited similar samples, sort of demographically similar samples, in the 1950s. And what he found was that the iq of the samples in the 1950s was about one or two Iq points higher than the samples in the 1930s. Now, he, of course, was expecting to see a because he believed the iq was going to be lost at a rate of around one point a decade as well. He actually found the opposite.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s not enough evidence yet the flynn effect has stopped in the west. What do you have is you have a few countries on a few tests which have produced consistent indications of decline since the 1980s. So you have, in case of norway, the famous conscript studies, where you have this iq loss of one to four points over 30 years. You have examples of this in finland, based on your own work, based on the army qualification test. You have the prga staging stuff, which, uh, in Britain shows an antiflynn effect, but in France actually shows the opposite, it shows a flynn effect. And what you have overall in these countries is is a tendency for flynn effect to slow but in no single country has the flynn effect actually gone fully into reverse yet. Itâ€™s certainly reached an asymptote in some countries, but the overall trend is still towards a flynn effect. And, what we do know from looking at the data that was collected by peachnig and Varaschek back in 2015. They did a huge, wonderful metro analysis on the flynn effect, which I would strongly suggest you go and you go and read if youâ€™re, if you are thus inclined. And they basically showed that thereâ€™s definitely true that itâ€™s, itâ€™s becoming very limited. It seems to be plateauing, but itâ€™s not gone into fully into reverse yet. So it might go into reverse in the next couple of years.</p>

<p>In Finland, it might have reversed. It might have reversed in I mean, you look at some countries like the nit in Estonia that shows a consistent flynn effect. But we know from the work of corgassal, whoever that was, that the ravens tests are showing the opposite. Theyâ€™re showing an antiflynn effect. So it really depends on the test to to sort of declare that the antiflynn effect has completely come into force, and really the overall trend is negative. You need to show this consistently across multiple indicators.</p>

<p>How do you square the flynn effect, the rize in Iq, across generate with with the woodley effect, that is to say, the decline in g, you call it the co-occurrence model, right? Yes. So whatâ€™s the co-occurance model? Itâ€™s basically just, Iq is not a homogeneous phenotype. Itâ€™s actually made up of different variance components. You have, for example, the,  the general mental ability factor that weâ€™ve talked about, which is very, sort of fundamental to intelligence. Itâ€™s that facet of intelligence that predicts performance across different tests. Itâ€™s what draws them into correlation with one another. We know that itâ€™s highly heritable. Itâ€™s highly criterion valid. Itâ€™s the bit of intelligence that predicts real world outcomes, for example.</p>

<p>And then you have these specialized abilities as well, which may or may not have criterion validity, independently of g depending on the ability, right? And these abilities lower down in this hierarchy, theyâ€™re not only more specialized in terms of the domains to which they attain, but theyâ€™re also less heritable, and therefore more trainable. So this is like skills, for example. So you could say something like shortterm memory is a skill which can be trained. There are lots of reasons why shortterm memory may be increasing. Thereâ€™s lots of opportunities to train in the environment. So theyâ€™re more environmentally sensitive. And because of that, we you consistent with that. We see lots of evidence now that shortterm memory is showing consistent flynn effects across different measures. Whereas working memory is showing the opposite, itâ€™s showing the woodley effect.</p>

<p>And this is because working memory is probably one of the reasons that G exists. Itâ€™s a very fundamental cognitive system, which is like an allpurpose problemsolving mechanism that involves, you know, manipulation of information, rearranging information into novel ways, that sort of thing. So, you know, obvious example is taking a span of digits and then getting somebody to repeat them backwards. Itâ€™s a very difficult operation. And the the capacity people have been doing that is much smaller than the capacity to have from repeating the digits forward. So much more effort is needed to actually manipulate and transform that information. And thatâ€™s what working memory is. So working memory is much more closely aligned to the centroid of g. Itâ€™s possibly even partly causative of the positive manifold, based on some models. And as a consequence of that, itâ€™s showing the woodley effect, because itâ€™s going down over time.</p>

<p>If our critics ask, why is it that if G is in decline, it shows up on the Iq test as a rise. Well, if you split Iq tests into different components, you can find the bits of Iq tests which show the decline. Itâ€™s just the decline is small compared to the gain. So the gain swamps for decline. A very good example is the Digit span test. Which is, which is the the element of the wechsler, which contains the short term and the working memory problems. So if you look at just the digit span test, that subtest digits, it shows no flynn effect, nothing. Itâ€™s just a flat line. But if you split it into itâ€™s g loaded and less G loaded components, you get the two convergent, you get the two diverging effects very clearly. So itâ€™s true that this gain in iq, right across the board, is going to be offset by decreases on specific items. Which, for whatever reason, are going to be more sensitive to the underlying decline in G. But we would predict based on the presence of chronic, dysgenic selection pressures. It just so happens that the environments are leveraging these gains among these other items. Which are more specialized and more independently of g, which have a level of full scale iq, which is just a grab bag measure of your performance overall on the Iq test, is going to reveal gains.</p>

<p>In other words, the Iq test is not a perfect measure of G. Obviously, G is going down. At the same time, these highly environmentally sensitive, specialized abilities going up to such an extent that they swamped the decline in g, and they turn up as a rise in iq.</p>

<p>I like to think of it like dark matter. Dark matter is a substance that allegedly exists in the cosmos thatâ€™s made up of particles that are sort of very weakly interacting to the point where theyâ€™re very big. And apparently we canâ€™t we canâ€™t detect them. Because they have weird properties that make them impossible to detect, except under very specialized circumstances. And even then, under those conditions, they havenâ€™t been detected. So how the hell do we know itâ€™s there. Why do we talk about it like it exists, but in fact, weâ€™ve never detected a single atom of it? Well, the reason we talk about it is because it can be detected through its effects. So if you look at galaxies, galaxies are held together with dark matter, and the way they rotate, they all rotate, all the bits moving at equal speed. That shouldnâ€™t happen if they were just full of visible matter. The different bits should have different speeds, and the galaxy should all just get munged up. Right? There is this dark matter present, which is sort of gluing everything together and holding it together. So as the galaxy rotates, it doesnâ€™t take on all these weird geometries and things, and it holds together as itâ€™s rotating. So thatâ€™s how we know dark matter exists, okay? And also, thereâ€™s gravitational lensing. We can use it because concentrations of it do interact with matter, gravitationally. So you can use it to sort of look at distant objects through gravitational lensing, that sort of thing. So even though weâ€™ve never found a single bit of it we know that it exists because of its effects.</p>

<p>And I think exactly the same thing applies to our work with the co-occurrence model, because the flynn effect is kind of like mainstream cosmology without the dark matter. There are all sorts of stupid things that should be happening to people in history if the flynn effect were a real increase in Iq. Like the retardation paradox and the heritability paradox. These, by the way, are terms coined by Jim Flynn. The retardation paradox is the idea that if we extrapolate back in time to 1900, right? And everybody is gaining three Iq points a decade, and people living in 1900 should have iqs of 70 relative to people today, right? And they should all be functionally intellectually, uh, intellectually disabled. Intellectually impaired. The heritability paradox. We know the heritability of Iq is very high, yet the rate at which Iq is gaining is way in excess of what you would expect based on the sort of degree of give. The degree of elasticity that would be allowed for within those heritability coefficients, very small amounts of environmentality. So you really shouldnâ€™t be getting three Iq points gained a gained a decade. Thatâ€™s just ridiculous. So you have all these paradoxes. Now we need something like dark matter to come along and fix it. So thatâ€™s what the occurrence model is. The cooccurrence model is simply the observation that actually, thereâ€™s another factor at play here, and itâ€™s something we havenâ€™t been able to observe because of the nature of Iq tests. These Iq tests, they fail measurement invariants. They tend to measure specialized abilities and growth of specialized abilities more and more and more in more recent cohorts. And this is whatâ€™s leading to the iqs apparently going up and up.</p>

<p>But we see these other things. Were are all the geniuses, according to Dean Keith Simpson. After Einstein, genius was extinct. According to uh Charles Murray, after 1800, geniuses started to decline to the point at which there were very, very few of them around by 1950, based on hueberâ€™s work. We know from macro innovations, which are the products and fruits of genius, they were four times of Victorians in the 1870s had four times the rate of macro innovation. To us. The last time we had macro innovation rates at uh, at the rates we currently have, was the 7th, 16th or 17th centuries. So whatâ€™s causing these trends to go down? Whatâ€™s causing genius to go extinct? Whatâ€™s causing innovation rates to collapse, and whatâ€™s causing all these other sort of general dysfunctions and things? Well, the answer to that is, there has to be a hidden variable. There has to be something happening, and that something is declining g thatâ€™s the dark matter, okay? But we, unlike dark matter, whereas cosmologists playing around with their experiments and things, trying to detect it, weâ€™ve actually been able to detect it. We have found what it is that is causing those declines. That which was previously hidden has now been revealed. And that is the socalled woodley effect, ie, the phenotypic decline in general intelligence has convergently measured using these sundry ability measures that we went into a great deal of detail discussing previously.</p>

<p>We wanted to work out what it is that actually causes the Antiflin effect. We used a technique called data synthesis. Data synthesis is not the same thing as metaanalysis, because this wasnâ€™t so much a formal metaanalysis. This was more a kind of collecting other studies which had, produced um, synthetic or metaanalytic treatments of the relevant literature, and then sort of harvesting from those studies those effect sizes that were relevant. So what we did is we collected together an extremely large number of observations, 66. These are any instance of any part of an Iq test that showed a tendency to decline right consistently throughout the full range of its measurement. We ended up with 66 observations in total, combined sample size of 302234 individuals. And we got studies showing Antiflin effects going all the way back to the 20s, which was quite impressive. So this is the biggest single concentration of Anti-flynn effects thatâ€™s ever been sort of committed to, committed to analysis. And what we what we wanted to do was we wanted to test a variety of theories concerning their causation.</p>

<p>And the theories iâ€™ve outlined here, they sort of decompose into four categories. There are genetic and demographic causes. Weâ€™ve already talked to death about those. So weâ€™ve talked about the effect of gene frequency changes due to selection. Weâ€™ve talked about, replacement migration, being one possible cause of Iq decline in particularly in developing developed countries. And also, emigration, selective emigration from developing countries, or brain drain, is also a source of potential Iq decline in those countries. So it sort of cuts both ways. And other things like, inbreeding, depression. So where populations are becoming more inbred, in theory, youâ€™d expect iq to decline due to homozygosity, increasing homozygosity for deleterious alleles.</p>

<p>Then of course, you have your environmental effects. So this would include sort of your usual suspects, deprivations in Healthcare, nutrition, etc, diminution of environmental quality. So this is Barbara Deminiâ€™s favorite one, that neurotoxins are making us all stupid and autistic and, basically, itâ€™s the presence of these um, I believe she she puts a premium on things which disrupt thyroid functioning. So things which inhibit the metabolism of iodine, I believe, are given sort of priority in her model. But there are others as well who have posited similar models, effects of lead, effects of methyl Mercury, etc. Um.</p>

<p>And of course, antiintellectual culture. So if youâ€™re growing up in an environment in which the, in which thereâ€™s no interest in intellectual pursuits and things, and youâ€™re actively dissuaded from doing this, it could inhibit your iq. And if thereâ€™s more of that particular environment going forwards, then, yes, the iq of subsequent generations would be expected to decline commensurately.</p>

<p>We have statistical methods like, item obsolescence. So this is where an item becomes obsolete, and you get it wrong because itâ€™s obsolete, right? It uses an oldfashioned concept or something thatâ€™s sort of drifted out of use. So itâ€™s a source of sampling error, basically.</p>

<p>And of course, there is pure sampling error, which is you happen to pick people who have lower iq, and youâ€™re getting a false signal of an antiflynn effect, because youâ€™re comparing populations with not, you know, not precisely matched demographic characteristics.</p>

<p>And thereâ€™s this final category here, which is called the hybrid category. This is first proposed by gerhard meisenberg in 2003. And the hybrid category, or negative social multiplier model, is like the negative, or inverse of the model proposed by dickens and flynn in their famous 2001 or was that 2002 psychological bulletin paper. And that paper basically proposed this idea that when you have this environmental enrichment, what it does is it boosts peopleâ€™s intelligence. But that creates a feedback effect. So people, once they have received this enrichment and this boost, will start demanding more cognitively environment cognitively demanding environments. And they will end up building, through a sort of positive feedback effect, a recursively looping environmental improvement which rebounds on the heritable basis of iq by setting up gene environment interactions. So the model is based on gene environment interactions. So in other words, you can leverage these big gains in iq and sort of break the stranglehold on iq of high heritability by having these environments rebounding on the heritability, setting up gene environment interactions, which suppresses the heritability and will allow the iq to just continue rising and rising. So this is how dickens and flynn try to solve the socalled heritability paradox of big gains versus high heritability.</p>

<p>However, Meisenberg realized that thereâ€™s an inverse to this as well, and that is the negative social multiplier model. So in other words, if you have some factor that is causing human capital to degrade, maybe itâ€™s a dysgenic trend, maybe itâ€™s something else, right? Something in the environment, something is causing intelligence to go down, that should, in theory, cause those individuals to demand less cognitively complex environments, right? And that should in turn, rebound on the intelligence of the population in such a way which causes a race to the bottom effect. So, as Meisenberg pointed out, the social multiplier model cuts both ways. S</p>

<p>There is a technique we can use to discriminate among these different putative causal models. And this we call the method of correlated vectors. And in a nutshell. All it is is a moderator analysis, and it just tells you if, if the if, the antiflynn effect, the decline, is biggest on subtests that are more g loaded, right? That suggests some biological factor is producing the decline. If the decline is biggest on subtests that have low g loading, that suggests environments of one sold or another, are causing the decline. So you look at where these neurotoxins, malnutritions and all these insults from the environment and all these terrible things, right? They all have their effect on when they have their effect on iq. Itâ€™s always on the less gloaded components. When genetic changes affect Iq, like inbreeding, depression, dysgenics, etc, these things always have their effects on the highest gload abilities. So thatâ€™s how we can tell, you see, thatâ€™s how we can pass out these causal models using this simple, quick and easy moderator analysis.</p>
