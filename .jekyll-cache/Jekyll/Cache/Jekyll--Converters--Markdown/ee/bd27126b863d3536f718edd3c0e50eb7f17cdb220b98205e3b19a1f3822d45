I"@<p>How important is the effect of mass media, pop culture and advertising on the drumming down of populations?</p>

<p>I’m actually editing a book at the moment on this very subject, on mass media and basically antiethnocentric messages and, and all this sort of thing. And what, what he argues is, yes, it’s demoralizing. You can demoralize a population. So you’re drumming it down. I take that to mean, you know, kind of making people capitulate. It makes people feel crap, and it makes them feel that it’s just not worth fighting for. It’s just not worth doing. And there’s just chaos.</p>

<p>I mentioned the new neurotic realists. What is that art saying that that that kind of art cutting cacao in half, or cutting a whale in half, or getting a cow’s head and then allowing maggots to breathe in it so that the flies all over the place, or or getting a, I know, an unmade bed and the crap on it and condoms on it, and whatever, whatever these kind of things were, the nice it’s just saying, life is meaningless. Life is futile, life is dark, life is bad drinking. Be merry, for tomorrow we die.</p>

<p>And so when you come up against a population that doesn’t think that, then you’re disarmed, and you’re in trouble. And so I would think that it would have a significant effect on them in a negative way and it would be consistent with social-epistasis. These mutants, are coming up with these maladaptive ideas, and they are persuading people to do maladaptive things. And they can do that through the organs of films and television and novels and art and whatever.</p>
