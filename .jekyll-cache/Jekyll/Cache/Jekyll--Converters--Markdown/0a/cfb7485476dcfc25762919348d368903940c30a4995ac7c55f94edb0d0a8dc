I"2<p>Should be compulsory, if you study, publish or start fighting in a journal, to have replicated it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree. And that is my own philosophy regarding publication. If you look at my published track record of papers, I tend to publish things, I tend to replicate things in blocks of two or three. So I had a big paper, which came out in intelligence, you know, I say big paper, but nobody bloody read it, in which I wanted to see if there was any kind of evidence of what’s called cryptic stabilizing selection on Iq. Do people with very high and very low iq have lower than average numbers of children compared to people in the middle, or is it linear, you know, is it the dose dependence? So the lower your iq, the more children you have?</p>

<p>And I got three data sets, ran the analysis three times, showed that it was linear, not curvilinear, in all three cases, using a very sort of sophisticated model that allowed me to really get to the bottom of this question. And, yeah, I tend to replicate things. I tend to always do things in twos or threes. And I agree, I usually, always, if I’m reviewing a paper and I see just one instance of something. I usually say, i’d like to see this replicated somewhere. I’d like you to come back to me with at least one other replication of this. Fair enough.</p>
