I"T<p>Is it possible that makeup is turning the human race uglier?</p>

<p>I wouldn’t have thought so. A big part of attraction is pheromones and smell and things like that. So I wouldn’t have thought that makeup would be having a big part.</p>

<p>Well, it might be concealing indications of increased mutation load. This is Michael Lynch’s hypothesis, the cosmetics might be playing a role in conceiving evidence of deteriorating character, deteriorating facial quality, and that this may be yet another factor that is, uh, reducing or attenuating a purifying selfelection.</p>

<p>Certainly, plastic surgery would be doing that. With makeup, she’s going to have to take her makeup off at the end of the day, and so you see what she really looks like. But with, but with things like blue boob jobs and, facelifts that’s more of a problem.</p>
