I"¢<p>That with regard to mixed race relationships, that thereâ€™s some evidence of elevated levels of mental illness. Um, and elevated levels of certain physical problems as well, such as headaches. People who are r strategists, and who will will select in favor of genetic difference. If youâ€™re in environment where you live fast, die young, you might as well select for genetic difference, because it will mean that they might have some useful gene, or something like that, that can, that can help you out. So youâ€™re attracted to genetic difference. And being um like that, will will be associated with being mentally unstable. And this will simply be passed on to the children. And it could be that thereâ€™s a degree to which thatâ€™s the case in terms of intereuropean um mixed relationships as well. Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s actually any data on it.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s one way of thinking about that. If you have select adaptive selections. This is stabilizing selection, where where you will actually have forms of centripetal selection, which sort of optimize individuals for particular adaptive optima by imbuing them with certain traits which are universal to those particular groups. And these could be immunological adaptations, these could be cognitive adaptations, these could be all sorts of things, right, which are optimized for a particular group. Then youâ€™re dealing with trait complexes, where itâ€™s youâ€™re going to have consequences if you pull those trade complexes apart and start trying to put them back together again with slight variance of the same genes, which may have attained different levels in different populations. And this sort of disharmonious combination of genes that you might get from certain distant crosses between ethnic groups could well lead to fitness depressing outcomes.</p>

<p>And youâ€™re right, thereâ€™s very little literature on this. Very little literature on this. Be quite substantially different. I mean, it wouldnâ€™t affect a french person marrying an english person in that way, would it?</p>

<p>Yes, it would happen the bigger the genetic distance the bigger the outbreeding depression, because thatâ€™s essentially what weâ€™d be dealing with. Here would be an example of whatâ€™s called out breeding depression. I was thinking about this the other day with regard to the, to the current population of South Africa. They are a mixture of white people and basically bushmen, like sand and koikoi. So that not just black, but the sand, the the bushmen. So and with the mix in there of Malaysian, and the malaysians of East asians and southeast asians are massively um, you canâ€™t get much more different from bushmen, than that, other than australian aborigines. So that would perhaps be helped partly to explain some of the anomalies in regards to the colors of South Africa. The cape cod, they have very high, but they have a very high crime rate.</p>

<p>Well, on the other hand, you also have examples of hybrid vigor possibly between certain certain crosses. What do you think of one type of sort of what? What does Steve Saylor refers to as tiger woodsification. And so it would be interesting to see, with respect to which traits people of mixed race background have higher levels, and with respect to which traits do they have lower levels. It was a good paper actually, published by Mortonâ€™s group back in the 1980s, which found evidence of heterosis on iq among chinese hawaiian native crosses. They found that the average iq of the Chinese and the hawaiian natives across is a little bit higher than the iq of either of the two parental races. Which suggests, perhaps that some of these crosses can actually boost these traits, but some of them might attenuate the traits or reduce them. And categorizing those traits into which ones suffer from hybrid vigor versus hybrid outbreeding depression, would be very, a very interesting and very useful exercise, which nobody seems to want to do, which I think is a shame. Especially, as you say, there are hints in the literature, particularly on mental illness and wellness and things, of outbreeding depression, which might, it might, it might benefit us to understand really whatâ€™s going on there. Yes, it could work in both directions.</p>

<p>I know that among marriages in America. It could be an element of what sex the partner is. So when itâ€™s a marriage between a black man and a white woman, then those marriages are quite unstable and tend to end in divorce sort of black goes for blonde stereotype, which would be consistent with r strategy and so on. But when itâ€™s, the most stable marriages in the usa are between a white man and a black woman, which is very interesting. Theyâ€™re more stable than being a white man a white woman, which implies k stratergy. Do you see? Yes, patterns of xlinkage and maternal overdominance effects and things, and mitochondrial effects, which might in fact lead to other more complicated polyhybrid mechanisms of inheritance, which could affect the outcome. But yes, a thorough study of this could be very instructive. I mean, admixture analysis is very, very useful to us for measuring the geneticity, and yes thatâ€™s actually a term, of traits measuring between group heritability. And global admixture analysis is a potent tool.</p>

<p>You estimated that it was 84 of the genome was the mind. And you would expect a k strategist to select for more for the mind. And so it would follow that they say, someone like Hawaii, you have japanese Americans and white Americans in Hawaii. And even though theyâ€™re quite different physically or whatever in terms of the mind, if theyâ€™re very mentally similar, they can, they can more than make up for that. And Rushton found these mixedrace couples in Hawaii, where one is Japaneseamerican and the other is white, theyâ€™re actually more similar mentally than white, white couples, or japanesejapanese couples.</p>

<p>I also know a paper, which I donâ€™t think was ever published, um, which actually calculated the rates of, uh, interracial marriage. And it was based on the prediction from Rushton genetic similarity theory, that the you could predict the actual frequency of interracial marriage based on the genetic distance between the two races involved. And it turns out that there is a, thereâ€™s an almost perfect correlation between the fst, so the genetic differentiation between the races involved, and the actual frequency of the marriages. This paper was never published, unfortunately,  which is a terrible shame.</p>
