I"Ï<p>Based on Hoovenâ€™s stuff. So we looked at per capita genius, and we we found that, based on his stuff, we were a third, third or a quarter of peak, or whatever. And based on that line of of trajectory, weâ€™ll be back to um in a 12th century level of per capita, of per per 10 million of population inventiveness, by the end of the century. So so in a century, we would have, we would have gone from the equivalent of being in 1600 to the equivalent of being in 1100.</p>

<p>Well, the question is, does does having a very low rate of per capita innovation necessarily entail deindustrialization? So is it possible to simply persist with a low rate of innovation just, instead of having new innovations coming along, you you just exploit existing innovations, and you exploit and exploit and exploit them until you get diminishing returns. So thatâ€™s kind of your question. Yeah, Iâ€™m not saying that weâ€™d go back to the level that we would be in 1100. Iâ€™m saying that the the, you know, presumably we as Bruce Charltonâ€™s, metaphor, we would live off the capital, until the capital, eat into the capital, and then things will will sort of go backwards, and we wonâ€™t be able to do things we used to be able to do.</p>
