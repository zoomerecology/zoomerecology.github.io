<p>Okay, so they would have been a source of uncontrollable mortality. So there would have been something that you couldn’t really control. You couldn’t predict when the virus was going to hit. You couldn’t really work out what was causing the sickness, or the mechanism of transmission, or ways of palliating the sickness. So as a result, it’s a completely uncontrollable source of morbidity or and mortality. So, yes, people who are smart people are going to work out that being around the infected is a bad idea. To be sort of folk germ theories essentially miasm theory, that sort of thing, which have certain elements of pathogen theory, certain elements of germ theory inherent in them. People who who work out these primitive models of transmission are more likely to avoid infection. So the advantage will therefore go to intelligent people who will keep a distance from individuals with a higher parasite load, essentially, who are showing symptoms of infection.</p>
