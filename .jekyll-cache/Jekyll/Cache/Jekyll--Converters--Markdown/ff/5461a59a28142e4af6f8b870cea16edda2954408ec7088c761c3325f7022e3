I"Ô<p>I would argue that actually the state of the literature of stereotype threat is worse than you make out. Thereâ€™s a paper by the geary group, which is a metaanalysis of stereotype is a predictor of sex differences in achievement, and it doesnâ€™t predict it at all when you control for covariates. And there is also a paper, which is another metaanalysis, which looks at the, uh, the effect on the black white difference. Tonight, I know there is another name the researcher who has this out, but they have it under review, and theyâ€™ve had it under review for 10 years with one of the top psychology journals, and itâ€™s just been trapped in perpetual cycles of review, and itâ€™s never been published. And itâ€™s been presented at a conference, never been published. And itâ€™s a, it basically just systematically disproves stereotype threat. It shows that it has no effect. And whatâ€™s more is, as you point out, the literature is hideously contaminated with selective publishing. Those there are huge asymmetries in the publishing, the the ratio of findings which are affirmative of a hypothesis, versus findings which fall close to the the midline, which is where they aught to given the sort of other properties of the studies. So that this dispersion is known as a funnel asymmetry. And, um, itâ€™s, itâ€™s horribly skewed for literature. So itâ€™s, itâ€™s a very bad literature. Apparently, itâ€™s not good. They need another theory, because that one doesnâ€™t seem to work</p>
