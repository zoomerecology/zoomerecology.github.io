I"„<p>Why are whites so humanitarian?</p>

<p>White people are evolved to not be particularly ethnocentric, but instead to follow a kind of a strategy of relatively low ethnocentrism. This allows them to trade. It allows them to develop. It allows them to build up a larger gene pool. This makes them to throw up geniuses, biogenetic chance, the genius to come up with brilliant inventions. And therefore, they are able to dominate more ethnocentric groups, despite being lowered ethnocentrism, by virtue of their of their genius. And the flip side to this general openness and the general lack of ethnocentrism is a generalized humanitarianism. And this is fine, I argue, as long as society is relatively religious and therefore relatively ethnocentric. And therefore there will be a degree to which that humanitarianism to foreigners, or whatever, to people over a different nationality will have its limits. But once the religion is is taken away and the notions of national difference and whatever collapse, then youâ€™ll just get a generalized humanitarianism. And you see this in things like mixed race adoptions, a generalized desire to simply sort of help everybody.</p>

<p>Whereas if you look at the northeast asians, for example, they do not adopt. That itâ€™s very, very rare. In fact, japanese and legitimate children get sent to the west, even though itâ€™s a very wealthy country. And even among black people, though, they do adopt to a greater extent than east asian children. East Asians, they tend to adopt relatives, which, of course, makes sense from an ethnocentric, from a genetic perspective.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s why I think weâ€™re, weâ€™re so humanitarian. Itâ€™s, itâ€™s a flip side, in some ways, of our openness, to our curiosity, uh, which results in our high genius levels.</p>

<p>One of the interesting arguments that iâ€™ve seen on this question is an argument put forward by Ian Jobling, who I doubt very many of you will remember. He was most famous for his work on literary darwinism theory. So thatâ€™s applying evolutionary psychology to understanding tropes in literature. So he wrote papers on pride and prejudice and how you have a sort of dad versus Cad life history division between the different characters and things.</p>

<p>But he also had a theory about sort of one of the things which makes europeans rather distinctive, temperamentally from other groups, and that is the uh. The idea that perhaps europeans have very high levels of humility. So his theory was that they have very high levels of humility. And this is something that could easily be tested in theory, because there are inventories of personality which sort of add humility huberist in as an additional dimension. In addition to the big five, thereâ€™s one called the Hexaco Model. And you could always look for group differences or population differences rather, on the humility Hubris axis on the Hexaco Model. That would be a very good way of directly testing  joblings.</p>

<p>Presumably, it would be quite difficult, though, to to make international comparisons on this for the same reason we found with big five comparisons between countries, that it mean that the people are rating themselves in relation to what is the norm. This is the problem. We didnâ€™t have any problem, uh, getting meaningful personality differences between,  ashkenazim Jews and various other religious denominations. Or even when we compared american whites with American Chinese with American Africanamericans, in the case of a paper I did with tommy and curtis a couple of years ago. And I think part of a reason we were able to make these meaningful comparisons between these groups is because these groups were all acculturated in the same way. So they all have the same broad reference set to draw from in terms of working out where they are, essentially.</p>

<p>The Finn effects. So the tendency for the finns to rate the highly introverted finns as those who look at their shoes while theyâ€™re talking to you, any extroverted ones as those who look at your shoes while theyâ€™re talking to you, about that what Yuri Alex calls the thin effect thatâ€™s that really is a crosscultural thing. So the comparisons within specific countries, I would have thought that, I would have thought that itâ€™s more complicated than that, because I would have thought that the japanese and the Chinese, for example, are probably, have, perhaps have higher levels of humility than europeans do. That would certainly be consistent with some of their behavior patterns. But yet in other behavior patterns. They are, they are more ethnocentric. They are less broadly humanitarian in their in their attitudes. In the Chinese, even though they have this humility, they are, if humanitarianism just means kind of generalized niceness, they tend to be much more brutal as well, in the way they deal with criminals. In China, itâ€™s incredible, historically, the things theyâ€™ve done, death by a thousand cuts.</p>
