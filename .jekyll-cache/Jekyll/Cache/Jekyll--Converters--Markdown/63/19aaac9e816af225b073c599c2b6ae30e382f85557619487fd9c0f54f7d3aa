I"d<p>What does science tell us about the Ectomorph psychology and physiology, compared to that of the other two somatotypes?</p>

<p>Well, this is actually an interesting thing, because when Sheldon developed the somatotype model, it was based on the idea of the marula. So the maruler is a very it’s basically an embryo, an extremely early stage of development, when you have these three germ layers, as they’re called. There’s the ectoderm, the mesoderm and the endoderm. And if you look at these three germ layers, from these three germ layers derive different tissue types. So Sheldon argued that basically, for people who are ectomorphic, these are people who tend to be extremely thin and tall and have larger brains. And that’s because the musculoskeletal skeletal system, the central nervous system, derived from this outermost germ layer, this ectoderm. For mesomorphs it’s the musketeers, the muscular system. It’s the central nervous system, or aspects of the peripheral nervous system. These derive from the Mesoderm layer. And the endoderm layer is where the elementary canal and the gastrointestinal tract derive from.</p>

<p>Now, of course, we don’t use somatotypes anymore because there’s some crudely polygamous division of individuals um into three types. We tend to talk about Bmi, or we look more broadly at life history tradeoffs against, say, tradeoffs between, say, height and, things like skeletal density and musculature and all this sort of things. We have more complex ways of looking at these things as sources of continuous variability among individuals.</p>

<p>But there are life history differences between people based on Bmi. And people with faster life histories do actually are at higher risk of putting on weight because they have lower impulse control. There are also correlations with iq, between things like height and weight. And I know of one paper which, a couple of years ago, actually looked at somatotypes using the old Sheldon classification scheme, and found correlations with Iq and educational attainment in exactly the direction that Sheldon proposed.</p>

<p>Now, his, his theory might not be entirely sound, but he was right about one thing, and that is, apparently, the more ectomorphic you are, the more cerebral you are the larger your brain, and the higher your iq, essentially. So that that seems to be one source of difference between the somatotypes, which he predicted back in the 40s or 50s or 60s, even when he was writing about this.</p>

<p>And, you know, an interesting fact about Sheldon was, he, he collected a lot of his data from taking naked photographs of yale University undergraduates. And after he died, it turned out he’d take way, way more photographs than could possibly be needed to sort of satisfy his scientific curiosity. So there’s actually big controversy about what to do with all this surplus material and why he might have had it in the first place. It was quite the scandal at the time of his death.</p>

<p>So just an interesting little fact there. Anyway. Well, no, it may maybe it was helpful. I mean, it’s helpful to have as many naked photographs as possible and charitable. And that’s my position as well, is that he was just an avid data collector. But,  but apparently a lot of people with you know, dirty minds obviously thought that he was servicing something other than science with these photographs,</p>
