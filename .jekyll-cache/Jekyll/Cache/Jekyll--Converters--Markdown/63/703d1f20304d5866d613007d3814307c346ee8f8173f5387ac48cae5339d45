I"Ÿ<p>Mutations cause more damage within inbred populations. So individuals possessing have less offspring?</p>

<p>Well, thatâ€™s a good question. So, so basically, the mutations, basically, the way it works is, itâ€™s a weird thing with within breeding. Inbreeding kind of concentrates, uh, deleterious variants within a population, but it does so in proportion to the historical legacy of purifying selection are acting on those populations. And sometimes you get this weird thing occurring, which is called inbreeding vigor, which is very, very poorly studied. Itâ€™s known only from some epidemiological contexts in which you have certain diseases where thereâ€™s a clear homozygote advantage, for a heterozygote advantage.</p>

<p>In the case of sickle cell anemia, where being heterozygous for the sickle cell allele, it means you carry the allele. You donâ€™t express the sickle cell phenotype, so your blood is normal. But what you get is you get some slight change to the blood chemistry, to the structures of the protein in the hemoglobin, not enough to actually cause the collapse of these cells under oxygen tension. Um, which is what causes the sickling. But itâ€™s enough to basically give these cells resistance to the malarial parasites, which burrow into these these, uh erythrocytes and eat them from the inside out.</p>

<p>So in order to, in order to sustain that advantage, what you actually want to do is you want to inbreed. You want to concentrate those, uh, those alleles in the population in order to increase the frequency of heterozygous and therefore, you you the fitness to being a heterozygote under these conditions of inbreeding exceeds the costs to being a homozygote, because of the way that these genetic variants essentially segregate, mendelian segregation, because itâ€™s a monohybrid. Itâ€™s a trait which has whatâ€™s called a monohybrid inheritance pattern. It means you need both copies of the dominant allele. Itâ€™s homozygous dominant condition. You need both copies of a dominant allele in order to express the trait of interest and, um, and thatâ€™s the disease Trait.</p>

<p>Now, only one out of four of the offspring, statistically are going to actually have the disease. Only one out of four are going to have both doses of delay of of the alleles. And thatâ€™s under conditions of sort of very high inbreeding as well. So under very highend breeding, we have pretty much the same people mating with the same people, in terms of levels of genetic similarity. You end up with a situation which, yes, youâ€™re going to have a high number of expressors, but youâ€™re also going to have even higher number of heterozygotes, right? The penetrance of the heterozygosity into the condition is go into the population of heart is going to be hard rather, sorry, uh, that echo thing is back again is going to be quite high. And that means, on average, your population is going to be quite resistant to the sickle cell condition.</p>

<p>So the other thing is about purifying selection that is interesting is the degree to which purifying selection persistently or iteratively reduces the level of a trait due to increasing homos I got runs of homozygosity with each generation, is a function of the countervailing strength of purifying selection on that population. If you you can have a population which persists under conditions of very strong inbreeding, where with each subsequent generation there will be no decrement of traits which are sensitive to homozygosity. If the rate of removal of those, of those alleles which in the homozygous condition lead to a decrement in the level of a trait, it, it exceeds the rate at which theyâ€™re coming together, essentially in the population.</p>

<p>So under really, really harsh purifying selection, your minimum viable population can actually be relatively small. If most of when that, most of that population dies with each generation, and the ones that survive to adulthood, or only that, have only the best allele combinations of the bunch, right? Then your population can persist for a very long time under conditions of strong, of high levels of inbreeding. You just need very high generational wastage in order to actually make that work.</p>

<p>But they almost all, almost all cultures seem to oppose people having children with people that are 50 the same as them. So so well, the thing about inbreeding thatâ€™s quite interesting itâ€™s something that would have been practiced to a very great extent by most humans. The most of their evolutionary history. And among those populations who live in a or have ecological subsistence paradigms, which are considered by evolutionary anthropologists to be the closest to those that would have been universally generalizable to humans in the pleistocene, ie, those that live under huntergatherer subsistence conditions. Consanguineous mating is is quite high, between 25 and 40 percent.</p>

<p>The ancient egyptians we know would, royalty anyway, would to marry their brothers and not fathers, not parents or brothers. When the tutankhamun was the was the result of a brother and a sister. Yes. Well, actually, very good example of this is you get, you get this extreme pedigree collapse among these noble and royal lines, yes, the pharonic lines. Tutankhamun, was, I believe, the son of Akhenaten. Akhenaten went a bit crazy and sort of came up with monotheism that few thousand years before people were really ready for monotheism with the cult of artem and I think it was his son who became pharaoh after him, and then it was his uncle I who I think took over as Pharaoh after the boy king, and all this sort of thing. So, theyâ€™re all highly inbred. Yes, I think arkanatan himself was a product of a a rather cystic union, and I think that.</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s a level of inbreeding which is unbelievably high. And thereâ€™s no level of purifying selection which can really protect you against the effects of incest. And for example, studies of Iq and incest are very rare. Most of the study, most of the effects of inbreeding are at the level of first cousins. We have really good genetic data on runs of homozygosity, how it affects iq with each generation. Thereâ€™s been a couple of really big, high impact papers actually quantifying through, looking at runs of homozygosities, estimating levels of inbreeding at the genetic level and showing the sort of changes in iq. Itâ€™s about three to six points a generation at the level of and this is really fascinating.</p>

<p>The level of brother sister matings. The Iq drop is something on the order of a standard deviation. And this is based on a very, very tiny number of studies. But if you want to shape between 10 and 15 iq points of your population average, then you basically encourage universal incest.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also the Habsburg dynasty, which is another example of a dynasty that sort of collapsed due to the inbreeding becoming a little too pronounced, and perhaps the purifying selection becoming a little bit too relaxed over time. But, motherson breeding is endemic among bees and rabbits.</p>

<p>Yes, you do get sibling, uh, sibling mating among insects. But insects have some clever genetic mechanisms that they use, like haplodiploidy and things like this, which can actually be used to offset the costs of inbreeding. Also, the there is group selection operating on these swarms, these swarm organisms, these new social or collective breeding insects, we have to be a little bit careful because some insects are collective breeders, for cooperative breeders, rather, other insects are eusocial. There are slight distinctions between these categories, but these are highly group selected.</p>

<p>So one way group selection can be a solution to inbreeding depression is you can actually have one group just take over and eradicate an entire group that has fallen to inbreeding depression, essentially. So you can have very, very quick replacement of one group by another um when one strain becomes slightly devitiated as a function of high levels of inbreading.</p>
