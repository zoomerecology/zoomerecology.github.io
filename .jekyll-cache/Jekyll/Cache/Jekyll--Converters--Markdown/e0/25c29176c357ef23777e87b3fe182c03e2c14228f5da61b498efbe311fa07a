I"(<p>In his life of pericles, plutarch tells us that Caesar, by way of a magnanimous rebuke, remarks to several welltodo foreigners who were clutching puppy dogs and monkeys in their bosoms, do the women in your country not give birth to children? considering the past fate of Rome, the mass immigration today and the coming onset of spinsters tomorrow? Can an argument be made for modern governments to justifiably enact regulations to require, or at least promote, productive, nationalistic families?</p>

<p>Well, this is, of course, what the based government of Hungary is attempting to do at the moment with the introduction of free ivf um for hungarian couples. Of course, Ivf. In England, at least one round of ibf is free. So we already have that, because of the sacrosanct nature of the National health service, or what is increasingly becoming known as <em>our</em> nhs. It used to be the nhs, now it’s <em>our</em> nhs. So we do actually have that, but that’s for everybody that lives in the country, of course.</p>

<p>And, in finland, you have to pay, it’s very expensive for this, ivf. So I would say, yeah. I mean, in Finland, they used to have, until about 30 or 40 years ago, a spinster tax in order to encourage women to have children. If you were an unmarried woman over the age of, I think, 30, you had to stop paying this tax. So, not, not unlike the bachelor tax, which they had in under the emperor Augustus. So I think that there should be attempts to increase the fertility of european peoples through these kinds of means. And one of the problems, of course, is is that you have to have two couples now to fund what has become this incredibly good lifestyle that we have. So and to get a house, and you have to have this nonsense in England, where you have to have a, you have to pay the down payment on a house of 10, which is enormous amount of money.</p>

<p>So those are all kind of things they could should, they need to do. First of all, we need to abolish the paying of deposits on mortgages. By law. That would be one thing that would help. Um, secondly, we we need to have, uh, tax incentives, very strong tax incentives for people that have, a master’s degree or more to have children. Um, or, you know, or a degree from somewhere respectable to have children. That would, that would, I think would be a good idea. Um, thirdly, we need to have strong disincentives for people that we don’t want to have children to have children, such as tax productions if they don’t have children. So I would be in favor of those things. I think they’re just a good idea.</p>

<p>The part of the problem is it doesn’t really seem to work. And we have historical precedent on this. There was at least one roman emperor who tried this to get his patrician class to produce more offspring. He actually taxed childlessness. But the problem was, they opted childlessness and paying the tax because the idea of having children was so onerous to them that they’d rather just pay a little bit more not to have the children.</p>

<p>Lee Kuan Yew, as well, in Singapore, attempted a series of unsuccessful incentivized fertility, including taking graduate students at the opposite sex and forcing them to go out on dates as part of a, almost like a military service type thing. They were, they were required to go out on dates and actually report to the government that they’d gone out on a date and all this sort of thing. And it didn’t work at all.</p>

<p>So essentially the, the, you know, the issue seems to be lack of religion. If you it’s pretty much the only thing that’ll incentivize mentality is religion. So any kind of, any kind of policy that’s aimed at promoting nationality needs to start with increasing religious sentiments. Otherwise it just won’t work. There’s no, there’s no secular incentive that will actually work.</p>

<p>The only two ways that we seem to be able to elevate religion would be, one, to remove these spiteful mutants, samarian types, from power, uh, in favor of groups selected religious type people, and thus make religiousness part of the culture and promote it, which is very difficult to do in a democracy. And two, to make people really, really stressed, and particularly their mortality salience higher. But also just stress in general.</p>

<p>So there was that study by Sharif and noren Zion, and it showed that at around election time, people become more religious because they’re more stressed, because there’s uncertainty over the future. Now, this is just priming, but that’s clearly demonstrated, people become more religious at election times. So, stress, we need to make them very, very stressed, and life needs to be unpredictable and whatever, then they become religious.</p>

<p>So that needs to be kind of government policy. I can’t think of how you do that. You’d have to have, what’s that film called where everyone can kill each other for one day a year, the pearl over the purge? You have to have something like that. And it would have to be random as well. It couldn’t be one day a year, because then you could protect against it. It has to be like, at any time that could happen.</p>

<p>So, I can’t see these things happening, certainly not inh, any kind of, maybe if Lee Kuan Yew was God, bless his soul, was around then. But, he was an amazing chap, wasn’t he was. He was very awake.</p>
