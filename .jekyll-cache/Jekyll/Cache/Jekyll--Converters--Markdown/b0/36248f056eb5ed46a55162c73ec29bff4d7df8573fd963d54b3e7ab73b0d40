<p>Why do whites have so many varied features?</p>

<p>Is this a reference to them not having one hair color? Yes. We looked for evidence of what we call the strategic differentiation hypothesis. So that is, if you take a bunch of measures that correlate through life history, is it the case that among more slower life history populations, or slower pace of life populations, to use the new jargon in the behavioral ecology literature, is there more variability? And yes, there is. Among among europeans, there is actually more variability for everything, for behavior, for appearance. We showed very strong evidence of this. But interestingly enough, this behavioral variability does not map onto genetic variability. Among europeans, there is, in fact, much lower genetic variability than among africans.</p>

<p>But a lot of that variability among africans at the genetic level may be due to the fact that different groups have had to deal with different sorts of parasites. Because parasite diversity is much higher in the tropics, so you have much more opportunity for parasites to act like a kind of evolutionary wedge to create ethnolinguistic fractionalization, you end up with more ethnic diversity, essentially. And you get more of that diversity tracking sort of the the topography of the or rather, that the adaptive landscape comes to reflect the the parasite load variability and the diversity of parasite species more so than anything else.</p>

<p>But yes, despite lower average genetic diversity among europeans and asians, there does seem to be higher behavioral and physiological variation. And the argument we put forward is that this is a form of niche splitting. So this is a way you can accommodate higher population densities. If you have high diversity, you have an opportunity for boosting comparative advantage at both the individual and the group level, for division of labor and functional specialization and social role specialization. And that that will lead to a lot of variety arising within the population.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re also different in terms of, in terms of sex differences, arenâ€™t we? The these kinds of highly niche evolved peoples like europeans are they have the biggest sex differences. Whereas those which are not, like subhan africans, the sex differences in size and in other factors, itâ€™s actually quite small.</p>

<p>I think it varies from trade to trait. I believe that Aj Figueredo put out a paper, calculated overall. Okay, right. And and it found that the biggest sex difference, the biggest level of sexual dimorphism, is on the green land iceelanders, and which I suppose youâ€™d expect, really and the smallest is at the the equator.</p>
