I"|<p>Is premature ejaculation correlated with R being used as a reproductive strategy? Doing the deed fast would be advantageous if used that way?</p>

<p>I would imagine, so. Because as you say, if you’re raping somebody and you’re doing it to pass on your genes, then you’ve got to get it over done with quickly. And I recall that in the keynesian sample, there was various people that could ejaculate, you know, immediately, you know, just beautiful. They were crazy. They were psychopaths.</p>

<p>Because if that was, that book called the on the evolution of rape, the history of rape. And they argue that one of the reasons why, rape has been evolutionarily adapted. We are basically evolved to rape. We produce more semen when we rape. Because it it sort of harks back to these gang raping history that can be found in human tribes, that if you’re a beta male, then the only way you can pass on your genes is to gang it go with other beta males. So therefore rape becomes about sperm selection, and therefore sperm quantity is elevated, in rape. And therefore people, are women, more likely to become pregnant when raped, or else controlled for?</p>

<p>So, so, I mean, that’s a very interesting issue. So I would think the answer would be yes. So I’m going to actually look into that.</p>

<p>If you think about the way this works, if sex is about bonding, and therefore about pleasuring the other partner, um, then you would think that that there would be, it would be good to be able to keep going for asians. And if sex is simply about getting the partner pregnant, and then you think that the benefit would be to get it over and done with quite quickly. On the other hand, I mean, I understand that you’re more like a woman is more likely to get pregnant if she orgasms. That would make sense. It’s a very interesting question. Thank you very much. I shall, um, I shall look into that.</p>
