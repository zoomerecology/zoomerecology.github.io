I"´<p>So what do you think of Aubry de Grayâ€™s work? Is the defeat of aging a desirable, or even noble goal? Itâ€™s the desire to make oneself mortal? Related to individual level selection?</p>

<p>Well, itâ€™s arguably the most selfish thing you could possibly want, um. So in that sense, yes, this desire is is heavily individually selected. However, itâ€™s something iâ€™d like, and Iâ€™m sure a lot of other people would like, to be able to live forever. And Aubry de Grey, as you know, he has this model, which is rather interesting. Is based on the idea that itâ€™s called, he has his program scns, strategically engineered negligence senescence. And the idea is to to target seven major factors, or sort of meta factors, associated with aging, and then develop specific, or bespoke treatments for dealing with each and every one of these. And these include things like the accumulation of intracellular junk, the accumulation of extracellular junk, free radical stress through lack of antioxidants, dna damage, mitochondrial dna mutations. Thatâ€™s, of course, what Aubry de Grey got his phd. In, was his study of mitochondrial mutations in the role of the aforesaid in aging. And there are several other of these factors.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s a promising model. And so far thereâ€™s no sort of, thereâ€™s been no real breakthroughs in this area. There are a few treatments which show some promise, like Rapamycin, metaphor and immune suppressant substances that seem to also have the effect of regenerating tissue. Querosinâ€™s got a lot of positive press recently for their possible synalitic effects, and so on and so forth. Um, but thereâ€™s, I mean, the degree work is very interesting. And iâ€™ve met Aubry a couple of times, actually. Heâ€™s a very interesting person. His beard is way better than mine. Itâ€™s like down here somewhere. So, when my beard grows up, has it maintained color? No, itâ€™s gone grey. Um. But it tends to do that in your late 30s.</p>
