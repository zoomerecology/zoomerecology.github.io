I"Á<p>I mean, if you think about it, it could be argued the ancient greek, I mean, the the ancient Greek, uh, society fell, what, twice, right? Like, so once the mycenaean sort of Epoch, and you had the classical people, yeah, the holocaust fall. That that that one, whatâ€™s that? Like, three thousand years ago something. Yeah, all right. Then you have another fall, which was, what about 700, 800 bc, something like that.</p>

<p>yeah, youâ€™re right. Thereâ€™s three. There was a, there was a known civilizational collapse. There was a mycenaean civilization, and there was a hellenic civilization.</p>

<p>And then youâ€™ve got the roman civilizational um collapse, kind of twice really.</p>

<p>yes, thatâ€™s right. But the the Greeks, Greeks in their athenian period, were collapsing around the second century bc. This was noted by polybius of Megalopolis.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s right. Thatâ€™s right now in the romans. But we know that under the time of Augustus um, well, indeed, indeed, even for 200 years before that, there were serious concerns about the upper class not breeding. And it was Augustus that took this very, very seriously. And was saying God, letâ€™s do something about it. Letâ€™s pay them to breed, because this is awful.</p>

<p>It actually didnâ€™t work. The patrician class, more often than not, took the tax. They took the childlessness tax.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why iâ€™ve said in terms of, in terms of um, where we are now, weâ€™re half peak of inventions. So 16 per capita in, uh, 1800, but now on eight, seven.</p>

<p>No, so itâ€™s four events per year per billion of the worldâ€™s population. The last time it was that low was Elizabethan, England. So weâ€™re not half people. Weâ€™re a third of peak. Yeah, pretty much. So, okay, so that that would put us around the time of Christ, though I was gon na say weâ€™re about 50 pc.</p>

<p>Basically, we can think about these per capita innovation races is as a measure of how diluted your smarties are, essentially. So if g is lower, and the other factors that contribute to genius are lower in the population, then a very big population will not necessarily lead to more genius. Itâ€™ll just lead to a more diffusive, you know, more diluted genius. And thatâ€™s what youâ€™re seeing. Youâ€™re seeing as populations growing, G is declining, group selection pressures are relaxed. Thereâ€™s no social benefits to having geniuses around. So even when theyâ€™re present, they tend to be sort of given a hard time. Theyâ€™re not, you know, theyâ€™re not recognized as having any value to the group. People are more instrumentalists, more hedonic, etc, rather than sort of transcendentally oriented. This is, you know, Charles Murrayâ€™s argument. So the cultural factor is very important.</p>

<p>Can I just say a massive, a massive peak in Inventiveness was about, what about 3000 bc? Yes, thatâ€™s right. According to we donâ€™t, and we donâ€™t, we donâ€™t reach that again, that same level of inventiveness till, what, about 1900, 1800. Does that imply we were really, really, really clever then, cleverer then than we were even in 500 bc?</p>

<p>We have found some signals of the bronze age collapse in ancient dna. So it could be that, although there would be cycles of time, essentially, and that weâ€™ve had, we certainly had a period over the last thousand or so years where Iq has been climbing. Um, we know this because of correlations between eye contactility. Maybe there was a period during the bronze age when the average polygenic score was maybe equal to what it was in historical populations. And there is some suggestions of this from our analysis of the ancient dna data from from the right laboratory, that there you can actually fit a kind of curvilinear form function to the data, whereby you get a sort of peak around the bronze age, and then you get a collapse, which actually continues into modernity, uh, which, which is quite interesting, because that actually suggests that really, the over even though there might be these little cycles, and in some popular some populations, when you compare them to others, might have been increasing, the overall trend from the bronze age to the present may have been an overall decline. So it might have been the next thing, we were super clever then, but just have less to work with, basically, yes. But maybe maybe this relates to the intensity of group selection as a mortality associated with group selection.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s fascinating. If youâ€™re saying, sorry, if youâ€™re saying that weâ€™re currently on four inventions, then that Iâ€™m looking at houghenerâ€™s stuff here. So four inventions would place us, no, in terms of half of peak. So that the current peak, the peak was 1816, the peak was 1817, whatever, the peak was 16. Anyway. So so and weâ€™re now a third of peak. So if we look at the earlier civilization, so weâ€™ve got the peak in about 400, something like that, and then another peak in about, uh, we go down 50 bc. So then, oh, so, yeah. So that would put us, so half of peak would be 350. Aed. That would be half of peak with the top being what is this time for Christ?</p>

<p>So this indicates that throughout the roman period we were in decline, literally in decline throughout the roman period.</p>

<p>With a possible sort of cycle, the micro social cycle, micro cycle. What basically we were in the flight was the Greeks, the romans, we were just declining.</p>

<p>The collapse of the bronze age was a europewide catastrophe. It involved an absolute gutting of the, uh, the populations of Europe, in terms of human capital. It was just massive death, massive amounts of famines, or techno, complex technological and economic structures which had arisen in this time period, knowledge of manufacturing, special metals, how to organize societies. If you look at social messini and Greeks, they had, they had welfare states. They had very complex mechanisms for regulating productivity. They had quotabased productivity. They had complex trade networks, which involved moving goods and services.</p>

<p>So we should think of the whole, the whole roman period as just a period in the decline of the west from its, from its peak, about 500, 1000 bc. Basically. The polygenic school data hints that this, although thereâ€™s more research that needs to be done toâ€¦</p>

<p>Fascinating, because it was our thing trends from the cycles, essentially to see whatâ€™s, you know, to see if we can, have you got any data we could construct a roman micro cycle? Or is there something thatâ€™s done that we tried using, I tried to do that using the reich data set. The problem with the reich data set is that the major drawback is with regards to the roman samples, as they over sample modern italians. So theyâ€™re having lots and lots of modern italians about 50. And they have nothing from the roman period. Uh. And then the the next italians come from sort of a neolithic and the paleolithic period. So they have very ancient italian genomes. But thereâ€™s a huge doughnut hole in the middle of the data where thereâ€™s just nothing.</p>
