<p>How would one objectively define a spiteful mutant? Can it be done with a pgs, well, actually, I think we have insights from our mouse research which suggests where the candidate genes might be. Weâ€™re looking specifically at the nlgn3 genes on neuroligin 3 region. Itâ€™s a sort of candidate region. These genes are highly phylogenetically conserved, and they also seem to be functionally conserved in so far as the genes across species seem to relate to aspects of species sociality. So, for example, you find them in drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. They seem to be responsible for aspects of drosophila sociality.</p>

<p>You find them in mice, where they can be manipulated, as we did, in such a way that makes the effects epigenetically contagious through social epistasis amplification. And I suspect you find them in humans as well, probably in humans of autistic like personalities.</p>

<p>Now, those who have sort of heard me talk on this before know that my view on autism is kind of a grab bag of largely unrelated social, deep social learning disorder type traits, which we need to make more sense of, both genetically and phenotypically. So essentially, uh, I think within that broader label of autism, youâ€™re going to find a bunch of deep social learning disorder traits, which are going to possibly relate to nlgn inhibition, and are possibly going to, uh, be associated with, uh, sort of the ability to induce phenocopying of, antisocial or asocial, rather title dis-cultural type type phenotypes individuals who come into contact with the carriers of these genes. And it might be that there are other factors that need to be present also, like having high intelligence makes you a more effective transmitter of the negatively socioepistatic patterns of gene expression. So it might be that there is a complex of genes there which combine to give rise to a particular social epistasis type transmission pathway.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s where iâ€™d look. I iâ€™d look at those particular genetic variants in humans and then sort of branch out. Essentially, by the way, I have molecular tests of the social epistasis model that Iâ€™m going to be conducting soon, using polygenic scores for fertility. Iâ€™ve developed a new method for quantifying expressivity of polygenic scores onto traits. And I predict that you might be able to use things like selfdescribed leftism to predict whether there are individual differences in the strength of the association between these polygenic scores and fertility. Is to manifest variables quantified as relative lifetime reproductive success. So it might be that having certain ideologies decouples the genotype from a phenotype in ways that would be suggestive of the ideology inhibiting the expression of those genes, which is a direct prediction of the social epistasis amplification model.</p>
