I"o<p>You state the rate of innovation is decreasing. How much of the decrease is merely down to the low hanging fruit of innovation being picked already?</p>

<p>Just as thereâ€™s this kind of idea that the space of innovation can is finite and can be exhausted, people have put forward these alternative hypotheses. And that is that the more innovation you have, the more opportunities you should have for sort of connecting, making novel connections between existing innovations, and therefore generating novel innovations.</p>

<p>So this, this kind of idea that the space of innovation is finite, is is counteracted with a counter factual that proposes the opposite, and they sort of cancel each other out. So that suggests there has to be some other reason for innovation rates declining. And indeed, we have this evidence which shows both phenotypic and genotypic declines in general intelligence and its genetic antecedents, which are clearly necessary criteria for innovation. So it, it would be very weird if the sort of temporal trends in macro innovation, the fact they map onto the sort of rise and fall of general intelligence. And the inflection point in innovation is about the same time the phenotype for intelligence inflected from, you know, going up to going down, and so on and so forth. It would be very weird if those things were just coincidentally related to each.</p>
