I"Ò<p>Iâ€™ve got this theory about beards. Beards are very interesting evolutionarily, because beards go gray earlier than hair on the head. And iâ€™ve seen people walking around in middle of the late 30s with gray beards and, you know, normal colored hair. And one possibility is that the beard is a costly signal in men. Because what it is, it not only does it artificially increase their apparent age beyond their actual age, therefore there is a cost to having it. Itâ€™s like an antineopne signal, but it also honestly signals youth by virtue of the color. And if it can stay this color, basically for a long period of time, longer than it should do, then it indicates good genes for neotony. If it just turns Grey.</p>
