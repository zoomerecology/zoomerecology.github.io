I"Û<p>Could race mixing, increased levels of race mixing, be a natural response to high levels of mutational load?</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think so. Um, the interracial coupling is actually much rarer than people think. But so this person, whatâ€™s his name? Kaufman. The guy who wrote white shift? Yes, Kaufman, Eric. Eric Calvin, thatâ€™s it. Kaufman, if you read that book, you see he talks about how whites are just going to be sort of blended away due to high rates of miscagination. But the fact of matter is that data, or later, his interpretation of the data, were wrong. The rates of interracial crossing actually very low, and are scale in proportion to the genetic distance between the groups and vaults so and you can see this if you look at admixture data.</p>

<p>You know, unlike kaufman, I actually have like, actual scientific competence, and I know how to look for signatures of these things in genetic data. So, the admixture papers that iâ€™ve published, you you can see, if you look at the sort of, you plot people out based on biogeographical ancestry, from like, most european to most african, and you have like a continuum. And if you look at African Americans, thereâ€™s huge clustering around the african wing, and thereâ€™s huge clustering around the european wing, and then you get this like bow tie, and it just tapers down, and you get this tiny, little isthmus in the middle. You get people who are sort of Obama, you know, 50, 50, right there in the middle, and, and theyâ€™re very very rare. And this sort of thinness of that is proportional to the genetic distance of the groups involved.</p>

<p>So if you take hispanics and whites, that is much thicker, right? Thereâ€™s much more people who are intermediary. But if you take blacks and whites, or whites and asians, itâ€™s much more like, width of that, you know, that that area in that graph is proportional to the genetic distance of the groups involved. So basically, kaufman makes a big deal about how all these individuals are now taking mixedrace partners and how itâ€™s getting more common.</p>

<p>Well, yeah, fair enough, lots more people are having mixedrace relationships. But those mixedrace relationships, a) are not stable, they break down very quickly. And b) they donâ€™t yield offspring very often at all.</p>

<p>We actually have some really solid unpublished data on this, collected by a colleague of mine in New York, who shall I wonâ€™t name, um. Heâ€™s actually very prominent academic. But yeah, he has this data, but heâ€™s not planning on publishing anytime soon. But they actually did this calculation in which they this analysis, which it took this huge data set of couples and looked at the fitness of the couples, and found that the fitness of the couples was 100 correlated with the genetic distance of the groups from which each of the pairs, you need to be individuals in the pairs, were drawn. So you could actually rank the like the fertility of the groups the coupling based on the genetic distance. It was like an almost perfect relationship.</p>

<p>And itâ€™s he did it to test Rushtonâ€™s genetic similarity theory, because this is a prediction that Phil Rushton makes, is that actually, interracial relationships, due to diminished genetic similarities, should be very unlikely to yield offspring. And that seems to be the case, and that possession of yielding scales in proportion to the genetic distance space.</p>

<p>Is that? Is that because itâ€™s more problem creating offspring, and theyâ€™re kind of Infertile? Or is that because there r strategies, because they do this, they donâ€™t have offspring?</p>

<p>We know from other data that has been published that that the variance, sort of preference for high genetic variance in partners is something that goes with low rather than high k, right? So people who have faster life history tend to like bet hedging genetically. Itâ€™s a way of hedging against some instability, is to have as much genetic variation in your offspring as possible. So you actually deliberately choose partners who are genetically dissimilar to you. And that way you produce much more genetically variegated offspring. Whereas K strategists are into sort of assorted mating, and they like the kids to look a lot like them. So they tend to have a preference for, like, keeping the heritability of the trades high across generation, cetera, Et cetera. Um, theyâ€™re all specialists and everything, so they like everything to be, you know, highly biologically prepared, rather than plastic.</p>

<p>But the it turns out, yeah, in terms of preferences for actual interracial relationships, yes, people with faster life history is more likely to engage in those. And yes, they also practice birth control, to us enough, to a higher degree than people with slow life industry.</p>
