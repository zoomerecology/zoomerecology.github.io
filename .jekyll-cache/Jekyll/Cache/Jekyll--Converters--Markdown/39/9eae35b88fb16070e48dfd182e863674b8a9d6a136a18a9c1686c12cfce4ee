I"Ø<p>S. Jounger, a war reporter, in tribe, argues that humans evolved to live in small, tight groups. Soldiers live in those in war. So returning is hard, thoughts?</p>

<p>I understand they, they create these very strong bonds in these community, in these little communities, and they, and they bond for life. And also, youâ€™d expect the culture shock, this model by caleb Oberg, the culture shock, this idea when you return something new, youâ€™re homesick, effectively to be stronger, the bigger the difference. And presumably the difference with being in the army and being in battle and civilian life is very, very considerable. And so therefore itâ€™s a a big shock.</p>

<p>Yes, itâ€™s often a, it seems to be interesting soldiers tend to have actually high fitness relative to other groups. And thereâ€™s this kind of myth that a lot of people who promote group selection, they promulgate this idea that altruism is one of these traits where the altruist has to sort of lose fitnesswise, and the only way you can pay for altruism is by having a huge fitness to pay off to the group as a whole. Right? It turns out that, yes, for some forms of, like hyper altruism, where thatâ€™s probably true, like in the case of genius, which is, I believe itâ€™s not a very altruistic state of being.</p>

<p>But in the case of military altruism, it turns out that actually, people whoâ€™ve seen combat, on average, have higher fitness than people who havenâ€™t. So it turns out that military men are at an advantage reproductively. So it seems that being an altruist actually does pay off directly at the level of individual selection. That this is better way of explaining how altruism persists within a population.</p>

<p>But could this just be because the kind of people that go into the military and want to be a group selected, and we should be group selected. And so they have this sort of normal desire, and therefore they have other normal desires. And this includes a desire to have children. Well, I mean, these people will be more group selected, yes, yeah, yeah. But women will almost certainly find them more attractive as well. Because women, women do find men who have seen combat quite attractive. That if there was actually a good study on this.</p>

<p>Actually an interesting paper by, Nicolette glace Gulac. Uh, white feathers and wounded men. Female patriotism and the memory of the great war, which is quite interesting, looks at the female side of the equation.. So a sort of sexual selection and warfare type of model. But yes, it seems that the men, thereâ€™s definitely, as Richard also pointed out, a sort of fitness premium to having seen some kind of combat, essentially. Or at least it shows it in combat. It shows these groups selected values. It shows things like rule following and um altruism and things like that.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™ve known these various mormons here in early these mormon missionaries, and theyâ€™ve all said to me they would never date a man who hadnâ€™t done a mission. That this mission they do, this two year mission. They do, uh, because and they the way they eventually, they basically were saying that itâ€™s, it shows that youâ€™re if every if you, if youâ€™re if brigham young university or whatever, every woman wants to do the mormon equivalent of have sex with, whatever it is, you know, hold hands with a a returning missionary. I mean, if youâ€™re a returning missionary, youâ€™re like a returning soldier. The Mormon lady, you get the best girls. A bit like being in the army.</p>
