I"Œ<p>Libertarian ethics derive from hebrew diasporic pastoralist ethics (those than can run away) whereas western sovereign ethics derive from western indo european agrarian militia ethics (those that remain present) â€“ which is a difference between the short term temporal and longer term intertemporal. which is why libertarian ethics are limited to volition, not like western, inclusive of reciprocity.</p>

<p>In other words, under western indo european ethics you warranty your words and deeds, whereas hebrew ethics are designed to be irreciprocal, and without warranty on purpose â€“ as is stated in jewish law.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you donâ€™t follow ethics of warranty, and instead if you follow jewish ethics, then there is no prohibition on creating and profiting from moral hazard (parasitism). And so if they follow irreciprocal ethics a group can specialize in profiting from moral hazard (parasitism), like lending usurious money to poor people, engaging in the slave trade, blackmail, slumlording and tax collection.</p>

<p>Whereas moral peoples specialize in the lower returns on warrantable and reciprocal goods that do not create incentive to retaliate (kill). WHich is why jews in Europe had such a problem, (and had population bottlenecks). A low trust immoral parasitic population hosted by a high trust moral productive population will always lead to accumulated grievances and explosive retaliation. But, none of us can look i the mirror at our ancestors and recognize them for their criminality â€“ although westerners since Burke certainly have done so.</p>

<p>Most other civilizations lack the intellectual honesty to look in the mirror at their ancestors and understand that their punishments were earned. In the case of the west our adoption of christianity demilitarized and fragmented europe to the point where it was the viking invasions that restored the western ethos, and the reintroduction of greek thought that lead to itâ€™s return to itâ€™s traditional vector after the damage of the abrahamic dark ages.</p>
