<p>The 10 000 year explosion. Has there been any new research into continuing human evolution since the book was published in 2008? And if so, what new insights have we gained?</p>

<p>Yes. Whatâ€™s happened is with, basically, research has shown that selection sweeps in on standing genetic variation in human populations are quite numerous, quite commonplace. I think about 87 of them have been discovered so far. Now, that doesnâ€™t mean that every gene in the genome has undergone a selection sweep over the last couple of tens of thousands of years, but it seems that very consequential traits certainly have undergone a selection sweep. There was evidence published of a selecting sweep favoring higher levels of general cognitive ability by comparing ancient and modern genomes with one another and basically counting the variants associated with cognitive ability and comparing the two. And this work has been replicated. This is brand new. But whereas the old study, I had 99 ancient genomes and quite a few more modern genomes. In this new study, there are have 4 000 ancient genomes. And, instead of data going back to the bronze age, data going back to the time of the denisovans. As a matter of fact, a denisovan or two in these data going all the way back to 100 000 years bc. So if you draw a line through this, the best fitting line is a linear increase to the time. It gets early increase in the frequency of these genetic variants over time. And this relationship, by the way, persists if you control the population stratification. It persists if you control for the quality of the genomes using different measures of genetic quality. So older genomes tend to have been subject to more dna decay, that sort of things, so you tend to get, you know, lower quality genomes, simply by virtue of age. So as a result, you control for that, you still get the trend. And you still get the trend when you control for a whole bunch of other things associated with the genomes as well. So itâ€™s a very, very robust trend. And whatâ€™s really exciting about it is they were able to actually take the same genomes, and we were able to extract random snips, random single nucleotide polymorphisms, and we could use those to make pseudopolygenic scores made up of random variants. And we used a monte carlo model to produce over 100 000 of these random polygenic scores. And what we found is, when we plotted those out over time, they were flat, no no change over time. And the the actual real cognitive polygenic score outperformed every single random polygenic score, which means we can strongly infer the presence of recent directional selection over the last hundred thousand years across humans as a whole, favoring higher levels of</p>
