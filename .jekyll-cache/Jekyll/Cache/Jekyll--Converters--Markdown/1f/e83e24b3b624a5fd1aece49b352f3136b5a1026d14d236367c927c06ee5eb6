I"Á<p>Could zombie films be a subconscious fear of multiculturalism made into acceptable form of art?</p>

<p>I have this idea about witches. Iâ€™m much more familiar with the witch literature than I am with the zombie literature. So I canâ€™t tell you much about the origin of zombies, or werewolves, or all these kinds of possessed things. These multiculturalist nutters do seem rather like zombies. They seem, they donâ€™t have a brain. They seem, they seem possessed. They are Automaton. They, they are aggressive. They destroy civilization. Um. So in that sense, i, as you could argue, theyâ€™re kind of like zombies.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve just rediscovered the Npc Meme meme.</p>

<p>They are the Npc Meme type people. And thereâ€™s a small group of people that are in these films that are but my favorite one is that one with that guy, whatâ€™s his name, Simon Nye. Itâ€™s a kind of spoof zombie film about 15 years ago, 15 years old or something. Hot fuzz.</p>
