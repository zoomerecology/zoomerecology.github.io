I":<p>I’m wondering if that’s confounded. I know that Satoshi did a paper on this, i’ve seen it elsewhere. But could it be that people who admit to being gay have higher iq, because people have lower iq more likely to feel stigmatized into not admitting it?</p>

<p>That’s a very good point. Did they test for that in the data? I don’t think so. I didn’t see any evidence of that in the Kanazawa paper, but that would be the obvious Khan found they would. Because it doesn’t make sense to me that they would have higher iq. I can’t think of any reason why you could control the religiosity, see see if the effect relates with religiosity. Religiosity mediates that association, and that’s a fairly good indication that it’s a, it’s an artifact of, you know, it’s, it’s not a fact of confounding.</p>

<p>Basically, sorry, gays are more religious. So could that be confounded as well? The gay being more religious thing. Are they more religious? Yes, according to every study i’ve written that gays are more religious. I didn’t know that. That’s interesting, because they’re more feminized, so they’re more religious. And heterosexual men being being feminized, being a woman, makes you more religious, because you’re higher in feminine traits like empathy and stuff. And this seems to predict being religious. Gays are higher than this than straight men, so they’re more religious. It makes sense to me. I can at least think of a theoretical rationale for them being more religious. I can’t think of theoretical rationale from being more intelligent.</p>
