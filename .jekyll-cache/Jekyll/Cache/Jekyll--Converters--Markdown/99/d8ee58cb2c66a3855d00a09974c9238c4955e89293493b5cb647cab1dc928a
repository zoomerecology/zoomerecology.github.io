I"f<p>Who is the more divisive? Karl Marx or Martin Luther?</p>

<p>Well, I would think in terms of absolutely altering the nature of Europe in a very fundamental way, and it’s got to be Martin Luther. I mean, this is totally rocked christendom, in the most extreme fashion, leading to numerous wars, or indirectly leading to those wars.</p>

<p>What I would say about luther, I might answer it a little bit more differently. What I would say about lutheran ideology is that it has objectively led to what Weber called the protestant work ethic. He actually coined the term protestant work ethic.</p>

<p>I mean that what he was talking about was calvinism, not lutheranism, okay, right? But, well, yeah, I think it’s more broadly protestantism, and luther would be part of that broader protestant tendency, right? But the point I’m making is that the culture-gene-coevolutionary effects of protestantism seem to have been salutary in terms of producing populations which are industrious, high Iq, etcetera, capable of maintaining high standards of living, etc.</p>

<p>Marxism has done the opposite. We have very little data on this, but what data we have suggests that in most places where marxism has taken hold, it’s caused Iq to decline. It’s like accelerated dysgenics. There was a paper by John Glad on this, and he estimated that soviet unions have shaped like three to five points off of the iq of the Russians due to selective immigration and just, uh, gemicidal murder. Essentially same with pol pot in Cambodia. And Mao Zedong, of course, was for targeting intellectuals during the cultural revolution.</p>

<p>So marxism seems to be an actively dysgenic ideology, whereas lutheranism seems to be one which is associated with positive, developments in terms of biocultural trends, culture, gene coevolution, etc. I would say that, although lutheranism may have been, in aggregate, responsible for what per capita death due to fermenting conflict over a longer period of time. The net effect of that has actually been good. It’s helped to sort of make the modern world, and it’s quite creative any of the desirable aspects.</p>
