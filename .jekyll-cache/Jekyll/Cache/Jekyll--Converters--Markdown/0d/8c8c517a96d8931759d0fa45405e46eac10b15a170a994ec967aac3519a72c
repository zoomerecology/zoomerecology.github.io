<p>What would you expect the verbal iq of 130 ashkenazi or spatial iq of 130 east asian to be?</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a principle called spearmanâ€™s indifference of the indicator. And itâ€™s based on the idea that, because of the G factor, measure of cognitive ability is pretty much as good as any other. So in theory, a verbal reasoning measure would be a valid measure of iq, just as much as the personâ€™s quantitative reasoning measure would be, or their performance measure, thatâ€™s their spatial rotational abilities. So in theory, you could just use that as a good baseline for their iq.</p>

<p>Unless theyâ€™re tilted in such a way that that performance on the verbal domain might be reflective of some nong variants. Essentially, that is influencing performance and beyond G in case itâ€™s not going to be such a reliable proxy for their general intelligence.</p>

<p>About China and the Iq going down, the iq decreasing because of, um, because of the one child policy and the consequent, abortion of females and the excessive males. And we showed research from mingwei, showed the I that the iq is actually. The paper he said he found something like, women who were intelligent in China were less likely to have babies, didnâ€™t he found that?</p>

<p>Okay, well, he did a paper, which was published in intelligence, on dysgenics in China, right? And and it was the genetics model, was that the intel women were having fewer children. Is that right? Well, he found with respect to both Iq and also with respect to uh measures of educational attainment, there were net associations. So normal disgenic processes are occurring in China. But what we found was that actually itâ€™s gotten worse over time, and that the one child policy has probably exacerbated it.</p>

<p>Because in China, they make a very big deal out of their their status, whether itâ€™s rural or urban. And itâ€™s like guanco or something. Basically, youâ€™re assigned to one of two levels of class. And youâ€™re either an urbanite, which is high status, or youâ€™re a ruralite, in which youâ€™re in which case youâ€™re a low status. And where your your status level is a function of basically affects or impacts your access to certain public resources.</p>

<p>It also impacts how certain policies affect you. So the one child policy is typically relaxed in the case of people who live in the countryside, whereas in the case of people who live in the cities, the one child policy is heavily enforced. So it turns out that this might have made things worse. And actually there was another paper by whale miller, uh, who looked at the Iq difference between rural and urban populations in China. And yes, he found that people who lived in the rural areas had much lower iq than people who lived in the urban areas.</p>
