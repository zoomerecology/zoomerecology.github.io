I"Ø<p>Rudolph Steiner advised that children should start to read as their permanent teeth were grown, otherwise complications, especially with eyesight. Is this sound to you?</p>

<p>Yes. Iâ€™d make a point on that, which is that one of the things that finns are very proud of is the fact that they (theyâ€™re slow life history strategists, of course) and so they start everything late. And so whereas I learned to read when I was about four or something, and could read when I started at school, I got no encouragement from my wife or anyone I knew. By the time my daughter was forced triangle three to try and teach her to read. And she did eventually read younger than most finns do, because I insisted that she do. So. With my son, I was more relaxed because my daughter had learnt to read. And so I just left to them. And now heâ€™s eight years old, and he can sort of read. And this seems to be a perfectly acceptable thing here. When I was eight years old, I was reading Roald Dahl books. So itâ€™s a very strange thing. But one of the things is, my daughter turned out to be longsighted. And of course, this wasnâ€™t diagnosed for ages because of it wasnâ€™t, she wasnâ€™t seriously reading until she was eight years old, or whatever it was. And so yeah, I think the younger a person, a child, is taught to read, the earlier theyâ€™re to catch out problems with the eyes. So I would have thought it would be sensible, for that reason alone, for people to learn to read relatively young.</p>
