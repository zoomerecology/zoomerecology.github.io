I"<<p>Us. How high has iq been recorded to have gone? What would an iq 300 or 400 be like? Would it be like?</p>

<p>Well, it’s unimaginable. You know, nobody has ever had an iq that high. And the idea that, it’s a, it’s almost impossible to imagine what an iq of that, that level would be like.</p>

<p>It’d be really clever.</p>

<p>Very, very clever, yes. But also probably quite weird and difficult to get on with and difficult to talk too.</p>

<p>Completely unrelatable. You know, you could use a meaningful conversation with somebody like that.</p>

<p>They’d probably be really obsessed with noise and stuff, and with sat with smell, and they’d have, like, they’d be hypersensitive, so they’d have an awful life. So, I don’t know what the highest, what’s the highest record? It’s about 200, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Actually Descartes had a an iq of something like 220, based on Cox’s estimates.</p>

<p>Yeah, but he didn’t sit in an IQ test, and we can’t actually know that actually. I think, I think, what’s a list here of the iqs from the Cox paper. How did she mesure that?
i
Oh, well, she used the ratio of mental to chronological age, and then multiplied that by 100. So she used the old Piaget formula.</p>

<p>I’ve got the numbers. The highest iq, according to Catherine Cox, was goethe, with an iq of 210. So it wasn’t descartes. Descartes had an iq of, let me just get that number for you. He had a virginal iq of 180, versus a goethe Chardly IQ of 210. Woolsey, 200, groteus, 200, Leibnitz. Newton would have hated this. Liebnitz, it’s 205. And goethe 210. And, uh, Newton had an iq of the mere 190. No wonder he hated Leibniz so much. Leibniz was a full 15 iq points smarter than him. I didn’t know what cardinal woolsey was so clever. Apparently he was. And it basically, if you look at the biographical data on these kids, right when their children, how many languages have they learned by the time they’re two, how fluent are they in in mathematics? How much astronomy do they know? How much general learning have they engaged in at this very early age? And if it’s sort of, by the age of two, they’re fluent in five languages and can solve complex mathematical problems and have a working knowledge of alchemy and, you know, uh, uh, theology and, and can hold their own in conversations with adults, and they’re sort of two or three, then, you know, they’re doing pretty damn well. So if you take that ratio.</p>

<p>It could be, it could be specialized abilities, though, like that boy in India, there’s that Boy India who who was a surgeon at age seven, he managed to do surgery on a girl’s hand.</p>

<p>Because that is a criticism that has been leveled at some of these estimates.</p>

<p>And they took it, they took him to London, to see, like, because he wanted, he had this idea that he could cure cancer. And the tv program about him, and it turned out that he his very good linguistic iq, but he was really quite deficient in sort of aspects of logical thinking. So it could be that I don’t know about cardinal Woolsey. I find that very surprising.</p>
