I"8<p>Making an argument is a service to the intellectual commons (or to put it better, it’s at least not imposing a cost on the commons). Failure to do so imposes a cost of maintaining the intellectual commons onto others.</p>

<p>Reciprocity demands mutual norm maintenance, which is violated by GSRRM. The reason GSRRM is permissible in self-defence, and commons-defence, is that it is a) reciprocal, but more importantly b) like violence, no means of achieving one’s ends is off the table, but it must be directed responsibly.</p>

<p>You can’t extirpate GSRRM anymore than you can violence (working with nature not against) but you can make a proportional response which returns the favour of costs against reputation. Individuals of this type whose arguments (such that they are) amount to ‘you just want a more technical excuse to use GSRRM yourself’ need to understand the answer is: yes, sort of.</p>

<p>I retain all means necessary to defend myself and the commons, whether it be shaming, or violence.</p>

<p>In light of the point about violence one may then say ‘you just want a more technical excuse to use violence’ and we can better see the nature of that statement.</p>

<p>I say: no, we want a more technical reason NOT to use it.</p>

<p>Because using it is the default. Why should I not use all means necessary in self-defence, when you’re effectively stealing from me and others?</p>
