<p>Is a third nipple a silent mutation?</p>

<p>I knew someone at school who had a supernumerary nipple. Oh, yes. Did you when I was, when I was at high school? Well, yeah, we used to have mandatory swimming, so it was one of our physical education requirements. And this individual had a, you know, he had a nipple on his back, which was, I guess quite an accomplishment in a way. I i my dog had a supernumerary claw on one of his arms.</p>

<p>Scaramanga, the villain from bond, from the go of a man with a golden gun. He also had a super mario Nipple. Um, kudos, bodkin. And there was a guy, there was a guy that was a chat show host in the 90s called, montel. Uh. As a black man, bald, and he had no nipples. Extraordinary. Yeah, didn’t have any nipples. Extraordinary. Already had to get a felt tip and draw them on. We shouldn’t. We shouldn’t. Montel Williams, that was his name.</p>

<p>My cat, Margaret has six nipples. Um, that’s normal for a cat, or for a cat, because they tend to have litters of at least three.</p>

<p>Do specific mental mutations correlate with specific physical ones?</p>

<p>Some of them do. We know that people that have low intelligence have smaller eyes, eyes that are either closer together or further apart, wider faces and smaller noses, in the same way that you see with fetal alcohol syndrome. Although that’s not to do with the mutation, that’s to do with neural pathways being interfered with.</p>

<p>Any specific mutations that are associated with specific mental traits? Lefthandedness and, and this associated with all kinds of negative things, minor physical abnormalities.</p>

<p>The big bad mutations like having extra chromosomes, like trisomy of 21 or aneuploidy, that that sort of thing, where you you get these down syndrome type traits, which produce very distinct physical as well as mental distinctive characteristics. Things like Marfan syndrome seems to be associated with very, very distinctive signs, like having no shoulders and having like cheekbones that stick out to here, and all that sort of thing. And there’s some indications that might be associated with certain mild learning mental impairments as well. Most of these things are going to be pleiotropic.</p>

<p>A lot of these genetic mutations are absolutely associated with with distinct and they tend to mental retardation. Things like that, are associated with retardation, in an extreme way, is associated with noticeable facial abnormality, Dysmorphia. And so in more subtle ways you get the same associations in a more subtle fashion. So always be concerned about people that have small nose.</p>
