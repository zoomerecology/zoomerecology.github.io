<p>Why do people who adhere to atheistic ideologies, Eg marxism, not have higher mutational load? Well, maybe they do. Does the lack of mutational loads among paranormal enthusiasts, I didnâ€™t do any of this, imply that Marx was selected adapted?</p>

<p>I the study on atheism indicated that people that believe in the paranormal show evidence of high mutation load. And they have more ace. They have hands which are more asymmetrical than controls. So they they reflect higher mutational load. And in so much as we can separate marxism from standard religiousness, people who are leftwing evidence higher levels of mutational load than people who are right wing, as evidenced in the symmetry of the face and in how attractive their faces are rated as being.</p>

<p>And being, traditionally religious, in contrast to anything else, is associated with all kinds of positive outcomes in terms of health, longevity, getting over illness and whatever. So I would say that in comparison to the traditionally religious, marxists very probably are high in mutational load, and so are people who believe in the paranormal.</p>

<p>I think that, marxism itself, what I would argue is that there might be some elements to marxism that are rooted in these heighty and moral foundations of fairness and harm avoidance. Well, more so fairness and harm avoidance, marxists and practice are very instrumentalists, and will inflict harm on those who disagree with them. So they might be very, very heavily tilted towards fairness, in other words, equality overall else. Essentially. So insofar as there might have been times and places in our history as a species which called for extreme resource equity, then yes, maybe those genotypes get selected and promoted.</p>

<p>So there has to be some selected basis to these people. They canâ€™t just be a function of defective cognition. It might be, however, that in modern environments, the execution of marxist adaptations, or these underlying, sort of fairness adaptations, might itself be contingent upon underlying genetic quality, in that youâ€™re more likely to become heavily skewed towards this particular moral foundation. If you are, if you have very low condition your low genetic quality or high mutation load. So this might appeal to you, because this would benefit you insofar as as youâ€™re, youâ€™re going to be at a disadvantage compared to those with a relatively lower mutation load. So it seems to be the logical strategy to pursue it genetically youâ€™re scraping the bottom of the barrel. So that might be one way of interpreting it. Is a sort of flag of convenience, essentially, for individuals with higher than average levels of mutation load to rally around.</p>
