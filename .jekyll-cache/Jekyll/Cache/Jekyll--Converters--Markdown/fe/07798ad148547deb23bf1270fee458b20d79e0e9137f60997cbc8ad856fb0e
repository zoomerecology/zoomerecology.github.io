I"<p>Well, the thing about eugenics is, it’s coupled, the first wave eugenics movement, is coupled with group selection. And it flourished at a time when there were very high levels of group selection. So we don’t have that high level of group selection, so we can’t ecologically, sustain those sort of attitudes. So instead we have antieugenics. That’s the sort of set of attitudes people, people insist on value equality among traits and diversity and all this sort of thing. So as a consequence, those beliefs are very well adapted to a regime of individual level selection, but they’re not very well adapted to a regime of group selection. So my view, is that unless you can get group selection going again, which might be very bad because of atomic weapons and things, then we’re not going to get a eugenic sort of mindset back again, like we had in the 20s.</p>

<p>And so presumably it could be argued that the in some ways, the Atomic weapon, because if we get group selection back, it raises the possibility of atomic weapons. The atomic weapon was the death nail of group selection, really.</p>

<p>I’d say actually, it’s climate change was the death nail of eugenics, because under the condition of a mild environment, you have more survival among individuals who ordinarily wouldn’t survive, who would be vulnerable to ecological instability. So you basically have a situation in which you have the reversal of these fertility gradients of traits like intelligence, because people have low intelligence no longer vulnerable to ecological shocks. They can they can produce offspring with abandon essentially and actually in excess of the number of offspring produced by people with liabilities.</p>

<p>So that’s what ecological mildness does, essentially, the industrial revolution. But it’s, not just climate change though. I mean, if we hadn’t had the industrial revolution, and we had this warm period, it wouldn’t be as bad, would it?</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. But the warm period itself is associated with relaxed intergroup competition, that’s true. So basically, you need that intergroup competition to have that sort of, those selection gradients to be present within the group that promote these socalled socially desirable traits. Why do we consider things like high iq and good character and health to be socially desirable? Well, we don’t actually anymore. If you look at, you know, neurodiversity and antipsychiatry and all these sort of movements, and these antisort of eugenics movements, you can see people don’t really believe those things are socially valuable anymore. Why did they believe these things were socially valuable in the past? Well, the reason was because, because it meant the difference between being able to produce offspring and not being able to produce offspring, under conditions of cold selection and under conditions of high intergroup competition. If I prefer circuits, we socially value certain traits.</p>

<p>So we socially value extroversion now because extroversion is associated with, fertility?</p>

<p>Extroversion is associated with, it’s certainly something that women would, in theory, prefer in their offspring. We know that because of the Vonstum study.</p>

<p>But, if you, if you were going to socially value things that cause fertility, then you’d socially value now, you socially value religiousness and stupidity. And we don’t.</p>

<p>I think, to an extent, we do.</p>

<p>We socially value stupidity?</p>

<p>Well, I think to an extent religiousness, no, because religiousness, we basically. With religiousness, we basically are looking at a group selected trait which has disappeared with the collapse in group selection. With respect to intelligence, it’s clear that there is no real value or premium placed on intelligence in modern populations. Highly intelligent people are critically underutilized. Part of the reason for that is because they tend to be more group selected. So therefore, they they tend not to be able to <strong>flourish under an ecological context which places a fitness premium on individually selected traits</strong>. And we know from the expressed or manifest preferences of women in hypothetical offspring sort of traits. What sort of traits would you put into your offspring if you were able to do so? They don’t value intelligence. They don’t value conscientiousness. They don’t even value agreeableness. They value extroversion, which contains dominance and venturesomeness and other sort of facets which are conducive to success in the sort of cut throat world.</p>
