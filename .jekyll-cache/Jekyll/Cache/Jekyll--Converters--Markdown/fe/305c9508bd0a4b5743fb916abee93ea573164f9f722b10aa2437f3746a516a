I"S<p>I recall you mentioned lesbianism may be a loyalty signal. But all the bi women i’ve met are our strategists, to put it politely. What drives that?</p>

<p>I can tell you about that. Bisexuality you’ve got. There are different things that are that are pushing a particular trait. And bisexuality, more than homosexuality, is basically associated with being a psychopath. It’s associated with serious mental illness. It’s associated with psychopathology. It’s associated with narcissism and whatever, all to a much greater extent than homosexuality. I can’t remember whether it was just women, I think it was just general. Just said bisexuality by Syndrome. Actually, it was both. Now you said it was both. So I think, I think that this is some thing peculiar about bisexuality, as opposed to what we’re talking about with lesbians. Tesbians, which is that you go through these little phases and and whatever, these Aloe parenting and this sort of thing. So I think that’s not inconsistent. I think bisexuality is associated with narcissism, psychopathic personality, lack of sense of stable sense of self. And these things would potentially military in favor of no clear or multiple sexual objects, or no clear sexual object, or no clear sense of your own death. So I think that that would, the bisexuality would be consistent with that um as I understand it.</p>

<p>There’s actually some debate about whether it exists in men or not. Well, there are men that have sex with both men and women, people like Lord Boothby, I’m sure. I’m sure there are. It’s just like, for a while, I seem to recall there was a debate about this involving J Michael Bailey, and [_ _], with data that seem to suggest that the majority of males who describe as Bisexual are actually exclusively homosexual, and are in the, you know, sort of one foot in the closet.</p>
