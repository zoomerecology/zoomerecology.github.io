I"<p>a boldness Iq, Baldness, Iq Association.</p>

<p>Now, baldness is related to testosterone, circulating testosterone. It’s related to the sensitivity of hair follicles located on the front and the back of the head to a testosterone metabolite known as Dht, or dihydrotestosterone, which is produced by a biosynthetic pathway involving one of three, five alpha reductase enzymes. So there’s three isoenzymes, and they all convert testosterone into Dht. So an interesting possibility is consistent with your sort of speculation that you have engaged in with Dimitri Vanderlin the bubble role of testosterone. And, and, you know, creative achievement, because you seem to have found these, you know, nontrivial associations. A logical prediction of your, of your, your theory is that nobilists should be, on average, more bald than the population. So get, why didn’t you do this? Here’s what you get photographs of. You know, baldness is an honest signal of testing.</p>

<p>You have to, you’d have to stop at a cert you’d have to control for age and things. There wouldn’t you? Yes, you could control for age, because, yeah, all men go bald. This is, this is, it’s a myth that that, you know, but some men are completely resistant to balding. It’s a matter of degrees, not kind. All men will lose, they lose a bit of hair. They’ll lose, on average, about 50 percent of their hair throughout the course of their lives. So some men, it’s a hundred percent of the hair in, the you know, in the, uh, in the top and the front, right? For other men, it’s, it’s a much smaller amount, and it doesn’t, you know, it doesn’t look like balding.</p>

<p>I’ve lost hair on my legs.</p>

<p>Well, that’s the other thing, of course, is body hair, beard hair, this, this hair is incredibly sensitive to D to Dht. It grows in the presence of Dht. So a vigorous beard would be an indication of high circulating testosterone and high dht levels. So that’ll be another thing I could look at. Nobilists, do they have facial stubble, even when they shave? Do they have like, morning, you know, five o’clock?</p>

<p>My wife, even on our wedding day, she turned to me at the altar and said, you haven’t shaved. I said, I bloody have shaved and and she’s like, at the altar. At the altar. Anyway, yes, that would be interesting, although I’m slightly concerned about how one would go about it, because, as you say that it’s a con it’s, well, there is a continuous thing, because you get some people the kind of, they go ball and they just stop.</p>

<p>Yeah, 35 is generally when you stop, right? That’s when you reach peak hair loss. So whatever you have at the age of 35, you almost certainly have at the age of 75. Barring disease or or chemotherapy or something, something is going to kill follicles, right?</p>

<p>So, so basically, the what you could do, my father started going bald in in his thirties, and it just moved back to my age with some men.</p>

<p>Most men, most men at terminal, terminal hair loss is achieved in the mid thirties. The thirties will be pretty stable there on out. Um. But most men, if they’re gon na go bald, they will go bald very, very early. They’ll start at 16, and they will be in norwood 6 or norwood 7. A map by the way, is the scale you should use to quantify hair loss would be the norwood scale, because it’s actually a well validated measure that’s based on the shape of the hairline, which you can actually, you can actually use visually inspection. You can get like raters. Show them the norwood chart, show them where the difference is, seven, seven point scale. Get them to rate your Nobel Prize winners, or males, of course. Get them to rate your Nobel Prize winners based on norwood and then see if, on average, then norwood level is higher than the population average.</p>
