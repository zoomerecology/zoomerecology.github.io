<p>Peterson is is making the the sort of the fulcrum fallacy. You might remember in previous conversations of mine, but iâ€™ve talked about the fulcrum problem. So you try to, uh, you basically try to affect some kind of evolutionary change, or try to create some kind of novel cultural formation or novel set of ideals, and all youâ€™re doing is changing the position of that fulcrum, that fulcrum being the focal point of selection. So ultimately, that fulcrum is not fixed. It moves around. And where itâ€™s located at any given point in time is really a function of the sort of pressures which are acting on the group, or the individuals comprising the group.</p>

<p>So Peterson might say that ethnicity is not the correct level of analysis. You may then go on to put on his wig historianâ€™s hat and say that with past ethnonationalism, um and but we ought to move on to some kind of idealism of whatever that may be.</p>

<p>But the question iâ€™d say, is, does Darwin necessarily agree with you? For example, do people who embrace this ties in with what youâ€™re saying, do people who embrace this idealism, do they necessarily go on to lead the most descendants under a regime of strong intergroup competition? Or under a regime where where those who seem to embrace idealisms of various sorts, not necessarily idealisms of the right, tend to have very few children compared to those who are more, shall we say, ethnocentric.</p>

<p>And we know this is true because if you look at the fertility data it used to be the case that there was this ushaped trend in fertility, so people on the far left, in the far right, had more children than people in the middle. Now itâ€™s j shape. So now itâ€™s the case that people on the far right have more children than either people on the far left or the center. Thereâ€™s very little difference between the fertility of those at the bottom of the J essentially.</p>

<p>So it seems that Darwin prefers the reproductive success of people on the very far right, and that they are probably going to lead leave a disproportionate share of descendants. And they will not be idealists. They will be ethnocentric. Yeah, itâ€™s a thing. So, you know, my question is, given the reality, this is not, this is not me saying, I want the world to be this way.</p>

<p>This is me simply saying, here are the facts. Here is the demographic data. Here is what the correlation this is what the distribution looks like. This is the correlation. This is whatâ€™s going to happen when you extrapolate across time. This is whatâ€™s going to happen. So given this reality, where are the evolutionary benefits to embracing Petersonâ€™s position on ideals? Because it just seems like, it just seems like an ideology of extinction to me. It doesnâ€™t seem like an ideology that will lead to the maintenance of anything that resembles western civilization going forwards. Indeed, that that future does seem to belong to these hyper fertile people on the right, essentially not not to these more moderate types in the center, or even on the left.</p>
