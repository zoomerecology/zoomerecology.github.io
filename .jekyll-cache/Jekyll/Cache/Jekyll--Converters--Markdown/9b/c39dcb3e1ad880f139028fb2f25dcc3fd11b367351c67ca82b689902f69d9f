I"Õ<p>Are you aware of the origins of the, uh, blonde blondism, eye blondism, I guess, eye color and their origin, whether sexually selected or domestication, as what happens when wolves domesticate.</p>

<p>Well, my understanding was that they came along once we had farming, because weâ€™re no longer getting enough fruit and vegetables, fruit and vegetables and so on. We have one crop. And so therefore, we werenâ€™t getting enough vitamin D. And so it allowed us to absorb vitamin d from the sun via our hair and via our eyes. So so that was one possibility.</p>

<p>I suppose another possibility is that, would blonde hair be a better means of a judging age, or something like that? Would there be a sexual aspect to it?</p>

<p>Yeah. So this is, this is sort of my approach to it is, but these are pedomorphic traits, or neotonic traits. So that is to say, they are juvenile traits which are retained into adulthood. And they therefore function as very hard to fake signals with youthfulness and vigor, yes.</p>

<p>And you notice it with children, that theyâ€™ll start off blonde and theyâ€™ll become dark. Itâ€™s pedomorphic in that itâ€™s, itâ€™s, itâ€™s maintain like. But the whole of being east Asian is, peodomorphic, isnâ€™t it, really maintaining these these babylike traits into adulthood.</p>

<p>So, yeah, as you say, a signal thatâ€™s hard to fake, these altrical type traits retained into into adulthood, and you have these long developmental windows, essentially. And yes, some indicators of this could be blue hair, blonde eyes. Interestingly enough, both are correlated with iq to a very small extent, the individual differences level. But blue haired, blue head.</p>

<p>So, yeah, itâ€™s exactly basically, we have a, um, you know, we have a situation in which apparently there are these small correlations there that. And it could, it could be a fitness indicator, you know. It could relate to mutation load in that regard, and that could explain why itâ€™s correlated with Iq.</p>
