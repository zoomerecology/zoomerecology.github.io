I"€<p>Where would you both be if civilization dropped within a day? For your own wellbeing and your childrenâ€™s evolutionary direction, where would you both want to be if civilization dropped within a day?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll answer that with a question. And that question is, how exactly is civilization falling in this instance? Because if you think about it, it makes a lot of difference as to how youâ€™d go about prepping for it. So if weâ€™re talking about a dysgenic sort of collapse, then the best place you really want to be is is an environment in which you can, uh, surround yourself with as many smart and capable people as possible in order to sort of stave off the very worst of it in terms of being able to have a decent micro civilization, like a little gated community, or being in a situation a bit like the mormons find themselves in some of these states, if they have these ethnic enclaves, which are normally Selfsufficient, or even a sort of Selfsufficient primitivism such as that that which characterizes the Amish way of life. Those are the sort of environments youâ€™d want to be in.</p>

<p>However, if the civilization was ending as a result of an asteroid hitting the earth, thereâ€™s really not a lot you could do, unless you have space travel.</p>

<p>So probably isnâ€™t going to be that one, though. Itâ€™s probably going to be the first one that you said, so we need to go and become Amish. Which, i, I donâ€™t think that theyâ€™re not a conversion oriented religion really. Theyâ€™re an introverted religion. They donâ€™t seem to take converts. Theyâ€™re an ethnicity really, as well as a religion. So thereâ€™s a bit of a problem.</p>
