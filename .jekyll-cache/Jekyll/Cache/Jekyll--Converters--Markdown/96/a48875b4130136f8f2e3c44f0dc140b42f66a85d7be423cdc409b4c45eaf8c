I"ï<p>Discussing upper limits on stable group selections, very intelligent deviation. Can that process be sped up?</p>

<p>I think the only way we can sort of speed group selection up is consciously, ie, by deliberately stimulating it in some prosocial way, in a way that doesnâ€™t lead to massive amounts of death and conflict and genocide, etcetera, which are, which is the usual outcome of largescale group selection. So if you can find a way of making cattellâ€™s cooperative competition work, for example, then maybe you can have a form of group selection which is more stable and doesnâ€™t involve one group sort of murdering everything.</p>

<p>The only thing is, though, with the group selection malarkey, is that itâ€™s so complicated the different combinations that make a group selected society at the optimum levels. Is that something we can understand enough to do it, to get it right?</p>

<p>No, I donâ€™t think we can do a better job than nature. Itâ€™s a very tricky balance, essentially.</p>
