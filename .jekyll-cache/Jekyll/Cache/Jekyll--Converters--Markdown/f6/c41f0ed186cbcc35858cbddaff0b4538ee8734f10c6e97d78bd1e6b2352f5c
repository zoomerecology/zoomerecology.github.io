I"…<p>International crop failure leading to exponentially escalating chaos.</p>

<p>I think it put it if youâ€™re looking at a situation in which the crops are failing for whatever reason, then youâ€™re looking at a cascade of chaos, which will pretty much end civilization. I think there are some models of the collapse of south american or mesoamerican civilizations, like the Incans and the amazon you know, the uh aztecs and these sort of amazonian civilizations which which link the decline of these civilizations with major problems that they had in terms of figuring out how to deal with monoculture when that failed. So they kind of used monoculture and ovary, but like the irish with potatoes, they had this mono, intensive monoculture. And when things shifted in such a way, or there was a disease, pest or something that destroyed the crop, they couldnâ€™t cope with the service, civilization started to collapse. Of course, they had all these positive feedback loops built into their own societies that kind of led to bad things being amplified exponentially into even worse things. So when things got bad, the belief was that they had to sacrifice more young males in order to appease the gods to make things better. But of course, this meant things got worse, because they just ended up decimating their own populations. So, yeah, the civilizations were pretty screwed even before contact with us.</p>
