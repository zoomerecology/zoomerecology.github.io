I"ü	<p>If society collapses, will we see a greater die out of intelligent people, since theyâ€™ve been out of darwinian selection for longer, and therefore have more mutations? And about this, the fact that they live more in cities?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure about this. Itâ€™s not so much for high Iq types, itâ€™s the high specialists. So itâ€™s those individuals who have become extremely specialized, k strategists, theyâ€™re the ones who are going to suffer in the event of a largescale civilizational declension event, so where the civilization literally collapses at the core. It transitions from, say, urbanization to agriculture, just like that, due to the mother of all economic contractions, and we end up with very good in North Korea, if you read descriptions of the famine in the 90s, it was people like teachers and doctors and whatever, they just, they couldnâ€™t make any money. They werenâ€™t being paid. They worked for the state, and they died.  And it was people that had some kind of more more sort of broad set of skills, such that they could, letâ€™s say, make nice food and sell it, that sort of thing. Weâ€™re more likely to survive in that indeed.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re shifting the selection pressure from specialists to generalists, essentially. And insofar as high Iq people might be somewhat more likely to be specialists, at the end of the day.</p>

<p>So it will select your intelligent, r strategists, I suppose, in theory. So people who can organize new leaders, who can organize, production, who can actually, who are highly generalized and who are very, very good at being able to, to, you know, manage, who are very good, obligate generalists. Theyâ€™re very good at being able to just move around an unstable niche, and they can always get the group to a position in the niche was going to achieve something. These people might be a bit exploitative and a bit sort of crude and a bit, sort of psychopathic. So it might be those sort of people who end up flourishing in leadership roles in that kind of a civilizational context.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a very good question. Itâ€™d be good, good basis, I think, for a science fiction book, actually. If someone was inclined, in a literary way, to sort of try and imagine what the world would be like. And, say, 20, you know, pick the Star Trek date. 2265 or whatever it is. Have a novel about 2265, about what itâ€™s called terrahawks. Statements democracy serious version of idiocracy. The terrorhawks date is 2020. You know, there were terahawks, yes, fighting zelda and whatever.</p>
