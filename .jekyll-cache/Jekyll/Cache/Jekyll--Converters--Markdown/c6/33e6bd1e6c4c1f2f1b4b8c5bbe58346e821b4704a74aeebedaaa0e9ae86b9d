I"õ)<p>If you were the grand maharajas of the earth, what policies would you enact try to prevent the coming collapse of civilization? Is it even possible?</p>

<p>The intelligence will continue to decline, because, as weâ€™ve said, there it seems to be some sort of builtin limit to how high intelligence can get by virtue of the relationship between intelligence and the ability to perhaps stupid intellect and being interested in abstract ideas. I donâ€™t know exactly. And and therefore that is a desire to substitute having children for other things, and to rationalize everything, including children. And also, and other factors that have made this worse, like feminism, which means that women want to marry hypergamously, but theyâ€™re more educated than men, and they canâ€™t. And so they donâ€™t bother at all.</p>

<p>And so so I think itâ€™s um inevitable that we, the iq will continue to go down. The only thing that could reverse it would be the reinstitution of preindustrial levels of child mortality of 40 or 50 percent. And if anyone would try to do that, they would be killed. Thereâ€™d be war. And wars often has a negative effect on intelligence.</p>

<p>But I think it can be slowed down. I think that there are various things which can be changed to slow down the decline. So if we think itâ€™s civilization is a good thing and barbarism is a bad thing, then presumably we want our closer relatives to experience less barbarism and more civilization. And therefore we can act on on that shared view, that starting point. We can act to slow things down, such as by doing things that will encourage more intelligent women to have children. Such as by doing things which will encourage the nurture of geniuses in higher education. Such as by limiting the welfare state so that it doesnâ€™t directly encourage people with very low iq to have lots and lots of children. We can slow it down such that potentially we could, um, store knowledge and things like this, and so that we could potentially possibly, or then possibly not, rise higher next time.</p>

<p>I think be really, the best solution would be diversification and as much of it as possible. You probably want to encourage interstellar colonization, if would be possible in the first instance, because at least then you can vary up your genetic variety among populations. And maybe instead of having one population at one point of time thatâ€™s, you know, going through a period of sort of civilizational Zenith, then you can have a whole bunch of populations, which will always be at one point or another in their cycles. And hopefully, if you aggregate across a large enough number of them, youâ€™ll end up with at least one thatâ€™s going to be producing something that looks like a civilization.</p>

<p>But weâ€™ve always had that though. Weâ€™ve always had, in the history of mankind, weâ€™ve always had, you know, at one point it was China, at one point it was Islam, at one point it was. Yeah, but Iâ€™m thinking of taking out the temporal aspect to this, because these populations have always been temporarily separated from one another, so youâ€™ve always had these dark ages in which nobodyâ€™s gotten anywhere, and thereâ€™s been no advancements at all. Anyway, because one group has always had to do all the heavy lifting, essentially, whether itâ€™s chinese or europeans or Arabs, thereâ€™s always been one group, but when itâ€™s reached its pinnacle, it has had to do the heavy lifting. So what you want is to just encourage as many different human experiments to use, uh, Ray Cattellâ€™s term. He was fond of this idea that cultural groups could be looked at as like because..</p>

<p>Well, the problem with that is that itâ€™s contingent on us being able to reach a sufficiently high level of intelligence to engage intergalactic travel, things travel, which is a much less of a onerous task than intergalactic travel. Fortunately, we donâ€™t need intergalactic travel in order to colonize stars in the nearby stellar volume. But the and thereâ€™s plenty of sort of prospectively habitable worlds out there.</p>

<p>We even get to mars? Well, I donâ€™t think we will in this cycle, but in the next cycle, maybe, because one of the things you sort of see with these cycles is they peak at different levels with each, you know, each one. So the Romans got to a certain level. They werenâ€™t quite at the industrial level, they were almost there. They had the elements of it, like even as well as the Greeks. Anything they did, they just tried water. Well, they had elements of it. They had steam power that had very limited uses in ancient Greece, that I think was restricted to sort of opening and closing doors on religious shrines and things like that, or little toys that span around because of little nozzles sticking out of them, and boarding.</p>

<p>The problem is, it could be argued that we, I was discussing, as you know, this with Bruce Charlton the other the other day. It could be argued that weâ€™ve been very lucky in this cycle. We weâ€™ve had the black death. That was very lucky because it, because it wiped out the, the massive was four percent of people in the in the european population, and those would have been the death and terrorism people probably. We had this very cold period, even colder, I think, than the they than they experienced in the previous cycle. So that was very lucky. And, a number of other factors that it, itâ€™s so unlikely that would replicate.</p>

<p>Well, there you have it, fermiâ€™s paradox solved. You heard it here first, folks. The dysgenic phase of the civilizational cycle is just replicated across civilizations across the universe. And nobody ever gets to a point at which they can do all the Star Trek stuff.</p>

<p>I have a book coming out where the whole end chapter is devoted to a really rather novel solution to fermiâ€™s paradox, which actually makes a lot of sense. Whatâ€™s up then? Ah, well, just very briefly, itâ€™s example to spoil the ending of the book, but fermiâ€™s paradox is, in a nutshell, I believe, soluble with with with two observations. One is, the social epistasis amplification model kind of makes it so that civilizations never actually can scale to the point at which you can have the requisite amount of social complexity to actually do these amazing things like going out and becoming a kardashev one civilization</p>

<p>i.e. putting all your orbital habitats around the sun, so it engroves it, essentially, and you end up with this dyson swarm that can just soak all the energy out of the sun. And you, you could therefore use the total energy output of the sun. This is a kardashev one civilization. You donâ€™t really need to go to other star systems to be able to increase the amount of living space within our immediate stellar volume by quadrillions of times. Itâ€™s, thereâ€™s huge amounts of space in the volume of the solar system. Itâ€™s absolutely huge. You could have quadrillions and quadrillions of people living in in just the volume of the solar system alone.</p>

<p>So basically, uh, the question is, why donâ€™t we ever get there? And the answer to that is, because the social complexity presents these spiteful mutations are such a huge target that they just, itâ€™ll just break down these complex social formations preventing them from being able to scale to the point they can actually maintain a civilization at that scale. So the very nature of our social bonding and social sort of binding is such, but the more of it there is and the more elaborated it is, the more easy it is to undermine through mutations which which are exquisitely adapted to taking those bonds out.</p>

<p>An observation which was made by a group of astrophysicists about 15 years ago, where they did a sky survey of of about two or three million stars which fell within the range of star types, but our particular star, I think itâ€™s K to J or something, but our particular star is is, it falls within this sort of narrow spectrum of stars. So they took about, I think it was two or two and a half million or something of these stars, and they looked at the light coming off of these stars, and what they found was that the light in a very tiny subset of these, around 200 or so, was modulated. They actually got and this was published in a serious astrophysics journal, so it was very big deal actually, when it came out, it made a lot of news.</p>

<p>But what they found was that the light was modulated. And when you did whatâ€™s called thuria transformation on the light, you got a sort of signal out of it. And they, they really, they speculated that, but what the light is, the modulation pattern in the light is artificial. Itâ€™s produced. They thought it was produced. They actually suggested it wasnâ€™t natural. It was produced by a large orbital structure, like a stellaser, as you know, a starpowered laser, essentially, which is basically just two mirrors of a hole in one one end. Itâ€™s a very easy thing to build, actually. Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s not beyond our current capabilities to do. You just need big mirrors, put them in orbit around the star and have the light bounce around, and focus it into a coherent beam and modulate it. And they press that, youâ€™ve got a beacon, essentially. You can use to, you can use to signal between starts. And they found yes, and a tiny, tiny percentage, apparently, they were. There were these Laserlike emissions pointed at us. And the reason that this might actually be advanced civilization.</p>

<p>So I propose is that they might actually have found E.T., itâ€™s just these et is stuck in their own cycle. Theyâ€™re stuck in their own cycle of time. You see, they theyâ€™re subject to the same dysgenic pressures that we are, in the same social epistemic pressures. And thereâ€™s reasons to believe that the other alien life may be convergently evolved with respect to us, because there might be a very limited range of evolutionary trajectories that you consume to sort of get to a point at which you can be a highly cultured using, tool-using type intelligence. So this idea of, you know, aliens being completely random looking is nonsense. That Simon Conway Morris and other people have argued that, if anything, theyâ€™d look a lot like us it converged on essentially, if theyâ€™re convergent on us with culture as well, then theyâ€™re going to be just as screwed over as we are. We might be seeing beacons of dead civilizations that are stuck in their own cycles of time, just as we are, and nobody ever gets out there, and nobody ever does any colonization, the same problems that are limiting us are also limiting these other civilizations. Weâ€™re getting that light from them.</p>
