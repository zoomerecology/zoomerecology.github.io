I"Ã<p>How many indigenous English currently residing in London?</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know. Based on the 2011 census, 47 percent of the population of London and greater London are white british. But that will of course, include people who are genetically welsh, genetically irish, genetically scottish. How can we possibly thereâ€™s not an option to provide that information. So I donâ€™t know so, but as an upper guess, letâ€™s say about forty percent.</p>
