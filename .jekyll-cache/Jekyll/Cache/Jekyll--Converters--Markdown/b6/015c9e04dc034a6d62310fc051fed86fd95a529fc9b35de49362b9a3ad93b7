I"é<p>the leftism, hyperegalitarianism, we see in the last 170 years, causes, mechanisms have counteracted?</p>

<p>I have been playing around with Jonathan Heights moral foundations, and I have developed an entirely new measure derived from his moral foundation scale, which I believe gets me the left right axis as a continuum with, you know, left at one end and right on the other. None of his horseshoe crap</p>

<p>But the idea is this, within haidtâ€™s moral foundations. As you know, there are five of them, six of them, if you include this sort of more vague individualism dimension. Letâ€™s ignore that for the moment. Letâ€™s look at the original big five, right?</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve got harm care and you have a kind of, you know, fairness axis. Those are two leftist measures. When you have these three other measures, authority, loyalty, purity, these three measures make up what you could call a binding cluster. Now, it turns out that you can take the two lefty ones and the three righty ones, and you can get, you can recover a meaningful dispersion in the factor structures, such that you get preferential loading of the two egalitarian ones on to be this factor, which you could call individualizing, and you get preferential loading of the three sort of righty ones for group, what I call the group selected ones, onto this general binding factor. Now, itâ€™s interesting, but actually thereâ€™s correlations among all of the big five. If you take those two moral super factors, the individualizing and the binding factors, you get a correlation of about 0.4 between them, which means there is a general moral efficacy factor. So overall, if youâ€™re high on one, youâ€™re going to be relatively high on all the others, but thatâ€™s not what interests me.</p>

<p>To get at the left right dichotomy, what I did is I took a different score between the two factors, so the individualizing and the binding, to measure how relatively high on one people are relative to the other. So I wanted to get that tilt, essentially, which is independent to the overall general moral factor. And we found that that tilt is a better predictor of most of the sort of relevant things like selfrated mate value how high you perceive yourself as a relatively valuable mate, weâ€™ve looked at, you know, a dark inventory, which is sort of measures of machiavellian narcissism, psychopathic personality. Weâ€™ve looked at various other measures. I wonâ€™t go into the full list, but weâ€™ve looked at six or seven different things, and longterm mating orientations, one short term weâ€™ve actually found the tilt is better than the individual dimensions are predicting the performance uh on these specific dimensions, these specific external sort of validity criteria. And in terms of a time series, weâ€™ve been tracking latent chronometric variables. For those of you who remember my talks on building these big, cross temporal latent factors out of measures of g declining, or measures of mutation load increasing, Et cetera.</p>

<p>We did a similar thing using these moral foundations in Google Engram viewer. What we found is exactly what youâ€™d expect. Over time, there has been a huge increase in the sort of lefty fact of the individualizing factor, and there has been a huge decrease in the binding factor, the loyalty, purity, authority factor. And they cross over at some point in the early 20th century. So, but one now is much higher than the other. The other is relatively much lower. And prior to that, the rank order was different, it was flipped.</p>
