I"h<p>I can answer your question directly. The answer to the question is yes. There’s a study by Sherman Figueredo and thunder which was published a couple of years ago, in which they conducted a lexicographic analysis of life history. And what they found is that swear words are more frequently used by people with fast life histories.</p>

<p>Now, another interesting fact, is swearing is also something that’s more common among people with high iq. So it turns out that swearing is more common among people with both fast life histories and high iq.</p>

<p>The other thing I should say is there’s class differences in swearing. Working-class people swear the most, then what you would categorize as upperclass people, or middleclass people, and then the middle so they they swear the least. And so it’s interesting, in terms of sort of the purity rule and stuff, you’d expect them to swear the middle amount most. They don’t. They kind of hyper correct, in order to try and be the most pure, which is an interesting testimony to the nature of the middle class and the virtue signaling nature of the middle class, that they swear less than people that are higher up the socioeconomic scale than them. But they do swear less still than the working class, which would be consistent with the, to some extent, with the Iq relationship and with the life history stratergy.</p>
