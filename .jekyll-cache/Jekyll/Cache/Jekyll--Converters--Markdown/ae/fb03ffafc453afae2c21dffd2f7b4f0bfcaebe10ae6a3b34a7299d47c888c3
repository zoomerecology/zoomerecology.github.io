I"2	<p>Is there any evidence for differences in levels of dysgenic breeding between different populations?</p>

<p>The answer to that is yes. We looked at race as a moderator the strength of the correlation between iq and fertility. We found it was a significant moderator. And the races are ordered as follows, in terms of strength of dysgenics. Whites have the least amount, followed by blacks, followed by hispanics. We don’t really know what’s going on with asians, we didn’t have any asians in our metaanalysis, but it’s very strong in hispanics.</p>

<p>I’ve actually seen instances of negative correlations between iq and fertility in hispanic females of negative 0.3. The average correlation across all of our samples was negative 0.1, negative 0.3 in the hispanic samples. That means Iq accounts for 10 percent of the variance in fertility within hispanic women. It’s very, very extreme. It’s three times the strength of dysgenic selection. So the answer to his question is absolutely yes. There are these differences, and they’re very, very substantial.</p>

<p>Why? Why would there be race differences? Well, the most likely explanation for this is that these populations basically have a, uh, these populations basically have responded to incentives for fertility control to a much different degree. The whites, for example, have been indisgenic fertility in the west since around the beginning of a demographic transition around 1800. These other groups transitioned into the demographic transition much later on, essentially. And as a consequence, dysgenics tends to hit you really hard as you’re undergoing the initial transition period, and then it softens off.</p>

<p>So because these groups are still catching up with whites in terms of demographic transition type, and life history changes. Their patterns of dysgenic fertility are are going to, are going to be very, very strong. The gradients of fertility are going to be very, very strong. And this will be driven to a considerable extent by the degree to which there’ll be a lot of early adopters among the cognitive, cognitive elites, among those nonwork groups, of contraceptive technologies and techniques. And this will initially create a considerable, very strong gradient, which will then attenuate as as those technologies become sort of more diffused.</p>
