<p>Overlap between r selected and spiteful mutant?</p>

<p>No, I donâ€™t think so. I actually think you probably have more spiteful mutants among k strategists. And but part of the reason for this is because theyâ€™re more effective in terms of getting power under a k selected social ecology. Theyâ€™re more likely to do the things, go through the rituals, go through the university, go through, you know, climb the greasy pole. Essentially put the effort into specializing so they can get into that position of power, so they can start doing the damage.</p>

<p>You can be very mutated, but in order for you to actually be spiteful, you have to get into some position to influence. I think a lot of these people would probably counter more or less as being slow pace of life, or slow life history individuals, but with very un-group selected mentalities, essentially. So you could argue they might represent a specific morph of slow life history, which is which is devoted to undermining rather than promoting the interests of the group. Which is a very interesting take on antigenius.</p>

<p>If you are highly case selected, one of the things that we discovered, one of my fundamental discoveries, is that one of the features of being a k strategist is that you tend to come in many different flavors. You can imagine, you can imagine K the continuum of light history speed, as being somewhat analogous to a tree. At the base of between all the roots at the base of a tree, you have the trunk, the narrow trunk. As you go up the tree, it branches out. So the higher you go, either slower your life history, the more k selected you are as an individual or group, the more differentiated you become. And this is an adaptive strategy because it leads to accommodation. Under conditions of high population density, and you get competitive release. You can have a sudden small amount of land sustaining huge numbers of individuals, because no two people are doing the same thing. So you get all this functional specialization division of Labor Ricardoâ€™s law, Et cetera, Et cetera.</p>

<p>And the advantage of this, of course, is that you end up with, uh, you you end up with high diversity within your population in terms of functional specialization, stratification, both horizontal and vertical. But the drawback is it might allow for more, negative diversity, in the sense of their arising certain morphs, which are specialists with respect to undoing things which are necessary to sustain, k selection in the long run, relatively high levels of intergroup competition.</p>

<p>And yes, because these people are constructed in a strategically differentiated way, you might see mixtures of fast and slow life history traits among these individuals, which is, which is interesting.</p>
