I"G<p>Can you talk about the downsides of Ivf? I can look at this in terms of how it affects dissolving offspring and the general population longterm. What ways could they be different from children conceived naturally?</p>

<p>In terms of the long term, it seems to me it’s rather responsible thing to do. Because if you, um, have fertility problems, and if these are not caused by having had cancer or something, I mean, if these are caused by some kind of genetic problem, then obviously the likelihood of you passing on these facility problems to the offspring that you conceive through Ivf are going to be quite high. And if both couples have fertility problems, so then both people in the couple, then it’s, it’s very high indeed. So you’re basically creating a situation where more and more and more people will have fertility problems and will be relied on ivf, which in a context, I would suggest, in which intelligence is going down, and which consequently, things we used to be able to do will be more difficult or proportionately more expensive. You are perhaps setting up these people for a situation where they themselves won’t be able to have children, so other than through ivf, so, which might be more difficult in the future. Those mutants genes will carnit with other mutant genes. And so effectively it’s actively helping to create, I think, a more, a more sort of genetically sick, uh population, and in particular, a more infertile population.</p>

<p>So, um, that seems to be a downside in terms of, from what i’ve read of those that have been conceived in this way, we talk about developmental instability. Of course, you have developmental instability at a very early stage. And so I wonder there is some evidence, I believe, I’m writing saying, about levels of adhd among people who are born from Ivf. So, you would expect, I think, there would be subtle differences in a negative direction. But it does seem extraordinary how quickly it’s taken off. And I mean, there must be so many people out there who are ivf from children. Perhaps they wouldn’t even know themselves.</p>

<p>I’ve heard with Ivf, yes, there’s a clinician who selects sperm. So what they’re doing is they’re looking for specific sperm. They’re going to filter them out based on characteristics and things qualities. And they will, in so doing, be applying a level of selection to the sperm, which might lead to a reduction in some of the more serious abnormalities associated with more, shall we say, Haphazard, fertilization.</p>

<p>They’re making certain choices that they’re not letting evolution take its course. They’re not letting experiments, that’s no, they are. They’re just applying a different kind of selection. Evolutionary, it’s there’s nothing you can do to stop evolution.</p>

<p>What could the difference be? The randomness first is what they’re doing. Could it could be a negative side to that? Well, there might well be, in the sense that, ordinarily none of these sperm would fertilize an egg. So, yes, you’re right. By by making it, by creating a a pathway through which a defective sperm con fertilize an egg, you are going to make sure that those traits that led to those sperm being suboptimal in the first place get passed on to the next generation.</p>

<p>So you’re selecting the best of a bad bunch. Yes, that’s right.</p>
