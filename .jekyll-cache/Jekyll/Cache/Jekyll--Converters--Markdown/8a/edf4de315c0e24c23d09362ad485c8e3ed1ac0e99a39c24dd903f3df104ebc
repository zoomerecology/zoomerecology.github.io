I"‰<p>Have you watched the joker? No, I havenâ€™t watched the joker, but i, I think some of the criticisms of it, uh, which iâ€™ve seen on youtube, seem to be quite prescient. And that is, itâ€™s, itâ€™s almost as if Hollywood is sort of coopting hopelessness and commodifying it and selling it and attempting to sort of make it unserious, essentially. And itâ€™s not, itâ€™s not a positive portrayal of anything. Itâ€™s just give you the impression that if you feel even remotely like that, then, well, youâ€™re a bit deep. Well. Itâ€™s sort of, itâ€™s sort of implying that, uh, itâ€™s almost ridiculing the sort of, um, you know, genuine sense of disconnection that a lot of young white males in particular feel in the mall, in the modern world, and saying, well, you know, itâ€™s just a slippery slope. As soon as you start feeling like this, itâ€™s only a short, sort of, hop Skip and a jump to becoming a serial killer. Itâ€™s that sort of thing. And, i, I donâ€™t really, I donâ€™t really like that. I, i, itâ€™s, itâ€™s, you know, itâ€™s nihilistic. It itâ€™s, um, itâ€™s poisonous. I think itâ€™s probably promoted by, uh, you know, evil people. Are probably evil people behind that, uh, you know, behind that film. And i, I donâ€™t, you know, I donâ€™t like that. I iâ€™d much rather hollywood produce uplifting, uh, creative, original content. So we havenâ€™t been doing that since the 70s, so itâ€™s not</p>
