I"¦<p>Any plans to research changes in personality traits using ancient dna? I suggest the indoeuropean economy, economy, lifestyle of cattle herding led to greater economic autonomy, and thus selection for more individualistic traits. Might would have any plans? Could that? Would that be possible?</p>

<p>Well, it wouldnâ€™t be possible with the current state of polygenic scoring. I actually have polygenic scores for, uh, various manifestations of neuroticism and depression. And the only thing I found is that they correlate very highly with one another. They donâ€™t really predict actual phenotypic measures of neuroticism and depression.</p>

<p>Polygenic scores big five, have been attempted. There was a paper published in twins research in human genetics about two years ago by viceâ€™s group, Alex viceâ€™s group over at the University of Edinburgh. Alex, of course, was a former student of aj. Figuerettos. But Alex, Alexâ€™s group, tried to look for variants predictive of the big five, and could find nothing.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this, of course, is the big client, I donâ€™t believe really exist um per se uh, that there is a big five. Whether it is the cost from Mcrae big five is is entirely conjectural. Itâ€™s probably more like Cattellâ€™s big five. So what you need is better quality phenotypes to run as part of these genomewide association studies. Otherwise youâ€™re just picking up on on noise, essentially, which is why they canâ€™t get these polygenic scores to predict anything personalitywise. So what I want to do, is I want to be the first person to run a gwas, which can now be done very cheaply thanks to some innovations in computing. I want to be the first person to run a gwas using the gfp and the big two, so stability and plasticity, the two super factors which sit above the big five, but below the big one, below the gfp. I want to actually do the whole formal hierarchical structure of personality. I want to run the gwas at all the levels of the hierarchy. And nobodyâ€™s talking about doing that at the moment. So I really hope to be the first. If I can get hold of the Uk, buy a bank, or some other data set, maybe if I ask Nick Martin very nicely, maybe heâ€™ll run it using his own data set he has over at Queensland,</p>

<p>But somebody has to do this. This would be a really important thing to do. And I think thatâ€™s when youâ€™re going to start finding polygenic scores that actually predict personality. When youâ€™re looking at the general most factors of personality, which are more like general intelligence, they have the highest cross battery, cross test validity, essentially like g does. G is in everything, essentially, uh, the gfp is in all the different personality batteries. So you really want the thing which all of these tests measure collectively, so you can get the most high validity polygenic scores.</p>

<p>Now, if we have those, we can certainly run ancient dna type studies looking at whatâ€™s happened over time with respect to these more life history, personal logical variants. These conative, to use Phil Ackmanâ€™s term from Connotus, meaning will, as opposed to cognitive so you have conation for personality and cognition for intelligence. So we look at whatâ€™s going on with respect to these cognitive variants. I think itâ€™s a very good question. Iâ€™d like to Iâ€™m sure we could test your your model if we had the right polygenic scores. We just donâ€™t have them yet. Thatâ€™s the problem.</p>
