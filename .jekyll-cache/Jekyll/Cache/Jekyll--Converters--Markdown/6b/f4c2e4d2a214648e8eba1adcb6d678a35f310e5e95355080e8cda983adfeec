I"n<p>In 1999, 1919 census by committee of inquiry upon the army and religion found that the world war one volunteer army had a much larger proportion of churchgoers than the later conscript army forces. This article shows that religious, well, just christians, are considerably overrepresented compared with the civilian population in the Uk. Uh, two to three, verses, one to two. In 2018, here is a paper in the Us. That examines the phenomenon in great detail, finding, as you would expect, conservative versus liberal, religious background makes all the difference. Thought it was worth a super chat.</p>

<p>That’s very interesting. So religious people are more likely to join the army. Are more likely to go in the army and lay in their life for their country. Presumably controlling for various things. Isn’t that absolutely fascinating thing, whether it was two to three, and the big thing was conservatism. So conservative, religious people are more likely to join the army. It makes total sense.</p>

<p>Yes. I mean, nothing would be more logical that they would want to. I would have to be conservative religiousness, of course, as he says, because liberal religiousness would be the one that would be messed around with and would become pacifists, and would be, would be perhaps even less likely to engage in it than than the nonreligious. Does it say that? I don’t know.</p>

<p>So basically, if we want to maintain a reasonable army, we have to be religious. And if we don’t want to meet, if we don’t want an army, uh, then we’re in trouble. And we will be overwhelmed by the religious does not remind one of anything.</p>
