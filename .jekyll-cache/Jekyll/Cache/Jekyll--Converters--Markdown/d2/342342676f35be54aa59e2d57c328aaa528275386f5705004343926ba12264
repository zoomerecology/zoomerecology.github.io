I"è<p>How do modern greeks differ from the ancients?</p>

<p>Okay, well, itâ€™s a very good question. But in terms of pedigrees, the modern Greeks are very similar to the ancients. There was a big paper in nature which came out a couple of years ago from the reich laboratory using the same data set that I used in my polygenic scoring analysis. And it turns out that, um, basically, if you look at mycenaean genomes and you look at minoan genomes, you actually find indications that the mycenaeans and the minoans are very similar to one another. They were really just the same sort of people, just living in different regions of the world. But one thing I will say for the myceneans is they do seem to have had slightly higher genotypic iq than the minoans, which might have explained why they were able to subsequently replace the minoan culture. However, the modern Greeks, in terms of the degree of genetic similarity to these ancient greek populations, going all the way back to these neolithic farm settlements. They seem to be more or less the same people. This, this idea that the the modern Greeks are heavily ad mixed with Middle East and African Haplotypes, does not seem to have been borne out by the data. There is some evidence of introgression from noneuropean populations among modern greeks, but itâ€™s far less than people thought. The genetic contiguity of the Greeks across time is actually very, very high. And this, by the way, was a theory that was put out years and years and years ago by a chap called dynaceys. He used to run an anthropology blog. This was his he was Greek himself. But the genetic data do actually seem to bear out his predictions that he was making. I think it was about 10 or 11 years ago when his blog was very active.</p>
