I"ø<p>How can next cycle will rise higher without being able to rely on the sequestered solar energy of fossil fuels? What energetic and thermodynamic basis?</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think weâ€™re anywhere close to exhausting the totality of the worldâ€™s fossil fuel Reserve. I think thereâ€™d be plenty left over for next time. It might be just a little bit difficult to get to some of the oil reserves or gas reserves. It might also be that we have to be a little bit more reliant on coal and wood, and wood gas for longer than weâ€™d like. Essentially, it might also be the case that we have to really aggressively, start taking up nuclear technologies as soon as they become possible.</p>

<p>If we are lucky enough to continue rising intelligence, be able to crack fusion, which is something weâ€™re not even, weâ€™re not even close to being able to do at the moment. Unfortunately, despite what a lot of hyper sensationalized press reporting is suggesting, weâ€™re not going to crack fusion anytime soon. Weâ€™re not going see it in my lifetime. By fusion, I mean controlled fusion reactions of a sort that can actually be used to produce heat, to boil steam, to generate, you know, to generate electricity. Iâ€™m not talking about detonating a hydrogen bomb, obviously.</p>
