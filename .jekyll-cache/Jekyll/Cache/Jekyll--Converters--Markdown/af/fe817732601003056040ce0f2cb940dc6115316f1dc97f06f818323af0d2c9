I"­<p>We know that, you know, thereâ€™s, there are associations between autistic like personality and paraphilias. And autism is on the rise, and it really is. I actually did an analysis recently. I wanted to see if you could explain all of the increase in autism using the decrease in intellectual disability.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re saying that intellectual disability diagnosis are decreasing. Yes, theyâ€™re decreasing. Thereâ€™s a theory that intellectual disability is decreasing in proportion to the degree to which autism is increasing, right? And this is called diagnostic switching. So the theory is that doctors donâ€™t want to tell mothers that their children are what in the olden days would be, you know, mentally handicapped or retarded. They want to tell them that theyâ€™re little einsteins and that theyâ€™re like precious. But autists, just like Einstein,</p>

<p>So so what theyâ€™ve done is theyâ€™ve substituted these older diagnostic labels like intellectually disabled for newer ones like autism. And yes, thereâ€™s a very strong negative correlation between the two for the data that I have covering the span of four or five decades. You can control one for the other. And all it does is reduce the rate of which autism diagnoses are going up. It doesnâ€™t actually eliminate that upward trend when you control one for the other in time. So it seems to be that autism is going up, and itâ€™s not simply because doctors are becoming more concerned about how they label odd behavior in children. The autism diagnosis really is increasing.</p>

<p>What is mediating the relationship between autism and fetishes. Because, as far as I can work out, and from what Blanchard argued it was to do with the relationship between autism and and anxiety.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think that, I think thatâ€™s too sort of psychologistic. I think that itâ€™s more fundamental. I think autists tend to be very thing oriented. Theyâ€™re interested in things and systems. Theyâ€™re not interested in people. Why would that make them sexually aroused by boats or cars?</p>

<p>Why do you think? Because boats are kind of things, arenâ€™t they? Theyâ€™re not people. Itâ€™s a person that has a specific interest in breasts. So, the the sort of deep psychosexual learning that goes into forming sexual interest and arousal activation patterns is going to latch on to things in the environment that give them pleasure, rather than people, because theyâ€™re not people oriented. Theyâ€™re thing oriented. So the sexuality is more likely to develop along paraphilic lines than it is to develop along heteronormative lines. And thatâ€™s the, that, thatâ€™s, that is the simplest explaination</p>

<p>I mean, if you, if you like being dressed up in leather and being put on a lead and whipped or something, letâ€™s presume thereâ€™d still have to be some sort of traumatic childhood humiliation that you were reinacting. Well, again, I think thatâ€™s, thatâ€™s almost sort of veering into freudian territory. Itâ€™s probably more prosaic than that. Itâ€™s probably more than, I donâ€™t know, some kind of association between a particular object and pleasant memories as a child, you know, metastatized into some kind of sexual interest in adulthood, into that thing. Sometimes they argue with like, letâ€™s say, spanking fetishism, or leather fetishism, or whatever, that itâ€™s a traumatic memory as a child that itâ€™s associated with.</p>

<p>Well, maybe, thatâ€™s the case. I donâ€™t know the literature on this. I i do know that the Paraphilia autism Nexus is real, that liturature does exist. There has been quite a lot of work done on that.</p>

<p>So if that were the case, though, what I just said, then wouldnâ€™t that be consistent with there being some element of high anxiety or something involved in the development of fetish, but itâ€™s a trauma based thing? Well, the, you know, anxiety is a personality dimension, neuroticism. So what youâ€™re saying is, there have to be two things presence. It would have to be a high trait, neuroticism and autism as well, and this third thing, which would be the formative influence. So this is the, you know, the bad thing that happened in the environment that led to this perfect storm, essentially that caused the Paraphilia.</p>
