I"@<p>What studies can I point my professor to to show that the upper class outbreed the lower class various points in history?</p>

<p>Best study I can recommend is the 2009 paper by viergaard skirbeck, published in the journal of demography, which is a metaanalysis of virtually every single study ever conducted looking at the percentage difference in fitness or fertility of those with high socioeconomic status, high occupational prestige and high educational attainment, versus those with low levels of these things, from 1400 through to the year 2000. So it’s very comprehensive. And you can see the those with high levels of social status are out reproducing those with low levels in Europe all the way up to the beginning of the 19th century, and then it becomes negative, and it persistently negative into the present.</p>
