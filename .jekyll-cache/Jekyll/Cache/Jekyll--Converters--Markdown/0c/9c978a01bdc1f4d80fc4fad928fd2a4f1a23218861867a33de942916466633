<p>FDogs have suspended features in infancy relatives. Wolves could hire Iq features specifically from enhanced imagination. Be suspended in efficiency in portions of preadolescence in your species? Could high Iq features specifically from enhanced imagination? Dogs are neotenous. So this is the imaginative people, higher iq and more childlike the suspended portions of preadolescence in I guess, even in humans, it’s entirely possible.</p>

<p>I’ll just distill the question down to the following vignette. Basically the idea is, are there facets of human cognition which are neotenous?</p>

<p>So creativity, perhaps, Could it be that creative ideation is like a hangover from childhood? But children are very creative. They’re very, very imaginative people who retain that sort of wonder, you know, about that innovative but things tingle the imagination, that sort of thing. People obviously know things excite them? Yes. People often talk about geniuses and whatever as being childlike.</p>

<p>There is a literature suggesting that, based on the biographies of these eminent men, that they are basically, uh, very yeah. They’re basically very imaginative. People have wonderment. And I think charlton uses the term other worldliness, a kind of otherworldly. And this, this aspect of their their temperament, essentially is is something which could be an exaggerated neopreneus trait, which is which carries on over into maturity and influences their temperament in in adulthood. I think it’s a very, very good question, a very good question.</p>

<p>I mean, because northeast asians are more neotenous than europeans physically, um, and I wonder if perhaps we are more neotenous than them mentally, and that’s why we’re more kind of creative than they are. That would be interesting. Oh, I should say it could be, because that’s how selection can work. In in very extreme cases, it’s called heterochromia rather, where you have juvenile life morphic stages being held over into adulthood, like selection for caterpillars that never turn into butterflies, for example. So there could be some heterochromic selection going on.</p>

<p>It’s very interesting in, uh, alice in Alice, alice in wonderland. And the there’s a sort of a Oxford dom character that’s basically meant to be Charles luther dodging himself, Lewis Carroll himself. And that’s the caterpillar, and the one that asked his philosophical questions. And of course, the implication is his caterpillar, he’s never quite grown up. He’s never quite become a butterfly. You could call this the dodgison effect or the carol effect.</p>
