I"Ê<p>Is homosexuality a consequence of childhood sexual assault, genetics, or a combination of both?</p>

<p>There are studies showing many gay were molested. I can answer that question for you. Itâ€™s a combination of both. The heritability of male homosexuality. I can get the numbers actually. Se inheritability of male homosexuality is 0.4 and iâ€™ll just check, uh, hang on a minute.</p>

<p>So 38.1 percent, uh. In this regard, thereâ€™s evidence that nonheterosexuals are more likely to have suffered sexual abuse as children. 38.1 for lesbians, 43.5 for bisexual women. 14.2 percent of heterosexual women, 18.6 for gay men, 19 for bisexual men, 4.6 for heterosexual men. So there you go. So, yes, it is.</p>
