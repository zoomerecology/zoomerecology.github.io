I"X<p>I think it’s like an honest signal of youth. So I basically think that what happens is you accumulate somatic mutations, and that’s what seems to cause hair to go gray. And the older you get, the more somatic mutations you accumulate in your hair follicles. So if you have good antiaging mechanisms at your disposal, like a good dna repair, protective factors like that, then you can stay brown, or whatever your natural hair color is, for longer. And of course, if you have, you know, lower quality dna repair mechanisms, then you’ll get gray earlier. So it’s usually in the 30s for men, I think they start to get their first couple of gray hairs, and then they kind of just flip in their 40s. Although I do know some guys in their 40s who are really, you know, not grey at all. So my father’s in his 70s, and he has no gray hair at all.</p>
