I"½	<p>Men cognitively asymmetric?</p>

<p>Okay, he might be talking about tilts. In that case, what tilts? Cognitive tilts. So symmetry in cognitive abilities. Okay, well, then you, you, you answered that, then go on. Iâ€™m going to have a bit, what I go what I hazard is that, uh, men are more tilted than women on average. Men tend to have more pronounced ability, tilts towards things like physio spatial ability. I mean, women are tilted also in the opposite way. But where women seem to have these tilt advantages is on certain measures of verbal ability, although the relative advantage seems to be somewhat lower. Which is a, you know, which is an interesting and interesting issue, and also one which is quite debatable.</p>

<p>But, yes, I think men are probably more profoundly tilted in in terms of having these sort of physio spatial aptitudes above and beyond other abilities. When you take out the g vectors.</p>

<p>Because they have to find some kind of very more specific niche than women do. Women are all doing the same thing in preindustrial period, and men are having lots of different things. Not necessarily tilt would would generally connote some specialized ability that had additive effects on the performance in the particular domain above and beyond G.</p>

<p>The tilt torwards physiospacial ability might be reflective of certain specialized wayfinding abilities, uh, the ability to sort of do cache location, the ability to navigate in a low contrast environment, the ability to sort of navigate in a, you know, in a high contrast environment, to be able to pick up patterns in, you know, very confusing backgrounds, that sort of thing. So that might draw on some specialized, visio spatial processing, uh systems, which may take up cortical real estate and may also have independent effects on, independent effects on performance above and beyond g.</p>

<p>Of all the group factors that have been proposed over the years, visible spatial ability is the one which comes closest to being a real independent thing. Why would the magnitude of the difference there, I mean, the magnitude of the tilt, be higher among men than women? Thatâ€™s interesting because it could reflect adaptive demands on males which are proportionately stronger for performance in that particular domain, which would be profound</p>

<p>As we discuss with the charismatic leader, the comedian, the the humorist. They have to be able to talk down other males and all this kind of thing.</p>
