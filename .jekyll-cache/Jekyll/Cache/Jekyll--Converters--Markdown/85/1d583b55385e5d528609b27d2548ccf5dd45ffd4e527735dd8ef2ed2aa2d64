I"6<p>Can someone who is k selective have large numbers of children?</p>

<p>Well, yes, and indeed they do. Because they they want, they want to nurture. That’s the what that they want. They wish to nurture. They are inclined to nurture. That’s what they that’s what they’re into.</p>

<p>In a context now, where you have contraception, people who are r strategists. They just want to have lots of sex. They don’t want to have children. They’re crap at nurture. They don’t want to nurture. And modern society kind of makes them nurture, or at least invest money in people that will nurture on their behalf, and so they they don’t have children.</p>

<p>And K stratigists, religious people are a good example of this, they want to have lots of children. They do so that would be the optimum. It’s really, in that sense, k strategy, lots of kids. And they are invest a great deal in them, and they nurture them.</p>

<p>But in the normal ecology, where there’s no contraception, then, yes, people that have lots and lots of sex will tend to lots of children.</p>
