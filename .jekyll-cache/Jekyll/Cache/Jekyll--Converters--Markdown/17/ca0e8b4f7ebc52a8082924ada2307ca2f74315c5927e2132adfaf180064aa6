I"{<p>I just wanted to wish you a happy pride month.</p>

<p>Although a week ago, um, I think it was the 18th of June, was, that was national, that was international autism day, which I celebrated. I had a very nice, fish meal of uh oysters and, shrimps, as they call them in in America, which are kind of very big prawns.</p>

<p>And, how did you celebrate autism day? Did you have a family over? Are you in America, aren’t you?</p>

<p>I spent, I spent autism day the way that one should spend autism day, which is, you know, rocking back and forth in one’s chair, typing out uh sections of the paper phonetically, without a care in the world.</p>

<p>Did you remember to offend some normies as they came in and asked you to do the washing up?</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, lots and lots of lots of normy offence was had.</p>

<p>Did you have to tell the nominees to turn their music down or or stop?</p>

<p>I did. I did have to tell somebody to turn their music down recently, yes, because normies don’t understand that. They don’t understand the need for quiet. Well, it’s not just normies, it’s the sense of people who are maybe not on the spectrum. It’s also low Iq people who like loud music and literally have no regard whatsoever for other people, in terms of the, you know, the annoyance that that might cause. Now, if it was good music, that would be different, right? But this wasn’t good music. This was exceptionally sad music.</p>

<p>mozart or something, I wouldn’t mind. But, well, I had a neighbor had a piano, and he played Mozart. I had no problem with that whatsoever.</p>

<p>Such a delight, a free rendition of something.</p>

<p>It was, I was, I was elated by it. It was, it was, it was heavenly. But why? Why? Why do you think that low Iq people like loud, banging, simplistic. I mean, loud music. Why are they like loud? Is it because it’s their sensory perceptions? Or they need more input in order to…</p>

<p>It’s a good, it’s a good question. The sort of discriminative faculties. I the ability to pick up on very fine gradations of things, which allow you to pick up subtlety in music, which is something that would attract high ability people to listening to certain kinds of music. You know, music with texture and layers, etc. The problem with the, uh, you know, the problem with with sort of loud, repetitive music, you know, music with a refrain. Essentially we get, like a bit that’s played two or three times throughout the entire duration of the song. I can see that appealing to people who are not really into the music, but subtlety purposes, they’re into it because there’s a jingle within the music which they want to hear over and over again, right? And they like the regularity, and there’s no sort of regard for subtlety there. But there’s variegation in musical tastes. And I dare say, but this, this association is not perfectly isomorphic to Iq. In fact, I know a lot of high Iq people who like sort of death metal and stuff like that, which is the most awful noise you could possibly imagine. Um, apologies to death metal fans out there, but, that, but it really is horrible noise, as far as I’m concerned. But they absolutely love it. And these are very talented people, and they go to these death metal concerts and things and listen to this stuff, and they have long hair, and, you know, they do the whole head banging stuff. So basically, it’s that iron genres, but, where it’s a lot of noise and banging and people going into microphones like that, that’s just like someone speaking dutch.</p>

<p>But, I was on the plane to Chicago, um, the other week, and this guy in front of me, after this off, the meal was finished, he was a euphemism, and he, and, he, and, he put his chair down, which on thin air, you can put down very, very far back, as far back as it could go. And unbelievably selfish. So I put my chair back as far back as it could go. And then the humble, modest fin behind me was moved to ask if I could put it up, because I put it so far back. So I then asked the the, um, the male stewardess, if he could ask the person in front of me to put the chair up. And that person refused and and said, no, it’s my right to put it down. And of course, the stewardess, male stewardess, couldn’t argue with that. He said, it’s his rights, but it’s his right to put it down that far after people have finished eating. I don’t know why that should be his right at any point. I mean, if you could ask people to put it up when the meal is being served, why not often put up more generally? So I thought, I have to. I want to get this person to put him up, put this seat up. I want to teach him a lesson. And so I argued with him. I know, you know, they’re very antisocial, and this is causing lots of problems. And basically, that this guy’s put his seat back. Everyone’s putting their seat back. Everyone’s basically being selfish. And it’s a trickle effect, domino effect that started with you. And he was kind of ignoring it. And I was asked, arguing that perhaps he was quite high in psychopathic personality, and perhaps it would be dangerous for him to enter America. And I should mention this fact when I got there. And eventually it occurred to me that, being low in iq, he would have less impulse control than me, as all our researchers indicated. So all I had to do was irritate him enough to lose his temper with me and threaten me, and then, of course, he would be in the wrong and they’d move him. So I just started, getting my tv screen in the back of my chair and continuously changing the channel. Poke, Poke, Poke, Poke, pose. And eventually he got up and informed me, um, the the the he was, I’m gon na you, you, if you, if you knock my chair again, I’m gonna cut you, [ _ _ ], he said, in front of witnesses. And I said, okay. So I went and got the mail stewardess. And of course, he had to move so, um. And I was, I was seriously contemplating mentioning this when I got into America, but I i couldn’t be bothered. But, yeah, they have low impulse control. And as long as you can trigger them in such a way that they they’re in the wrong, but they can’t go further than they want to, then you can kind of get what you want.</p>
