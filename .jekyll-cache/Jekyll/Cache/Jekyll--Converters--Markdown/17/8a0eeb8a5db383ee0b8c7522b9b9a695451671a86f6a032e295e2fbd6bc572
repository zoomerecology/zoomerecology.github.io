I"á<p>Is the large divergence in birth rate between haredi and secular Jews leading to aggressive decline in G in Israel. Any other disgenic effects?</p>

<p>Well, theyâ€™re about third of the population now in Israel. Yeah, coming very much from an ascendant group. And they donâ€™t do national service. So they wonâ€™t do national service. Itâ€™s a big thing in Israel. You have to, everyone has to do two years national service, and theyâ€™re allowed not to do it because theyâ€™re too religious to do it. So, um, I would assume theyâ€™d be less intelligent than, theyâ€™d have lower um intelligence than the than the um the secular Israelis um. As for other dysgenic effects? Certainly thereâ€™s a leftist, <strong>increasing leftist throw open the floodgates, throw over the doors to immigration</strong>. Stop us being an ethnic state movement in Israel, thatâ€™s for sure. So, so you could that may be a consequence of justice.</p>

<p>I know they are a country very secretive about their Iq data. I know that itâ€™s very difficult to get a hold of, uh, Iq data from they have it for their conscripts, but they donâ€™t let it out of their site. They keep it under lock and key. Or even if youâ€™re an israeli academic, even if youâ€™re in Israel I know a couple of israeli academics, and they throw their hands up and they say, weâ€™ve been trying to get hold of some of the stuff for a long time, and the israeli government just will not let us have it. So apparently no one can get a hold of it except the israeli military. So maybe, maybe, I donâ€™t know someone who works with the israeli military, or whoâ€™s in the israeli military, who, you know, is associated with their sort of personnel selection division or something, maybe they can get, maybe theyâ€™ll get access to it. But itâ€™s, itâ€™s, you know, itâ€™s a very tough if. Okay, so if youâ€™ve got a death wish and youâ€™re working in the israeli military, please get in touch with us, if you donâ€™t mind mossad abducting you and killing you,</p>
