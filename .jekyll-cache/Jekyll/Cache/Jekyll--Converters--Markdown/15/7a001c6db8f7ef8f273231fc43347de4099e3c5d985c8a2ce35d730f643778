I"ó<p>Are you making a connection between your body type and your ability to to walk or move long distances? Isnâ€™t that racist? I thought it was all to do with, like, the people that were made to run to school with no shoes.</p>

<p>I take it back. But the grate Angela Saini, corrected us on on this matter. And thereâ€™s no association between genes for body type and particular domains of athletic excellence. So as a consequence, itâ€™s just arbitrary, right? If you, if you have lots of slow release muscle fibers, slow muscle fibers that wonâ€™t have any effect on your ability to walk 50 kilometers. If you have lots of slow, slow release muscle fibers, thereâ€™s no reason why you couldnâ€™t win a sprint against Chris Cabusi. Has nothing to do with it. And the fact that most people that do win sprints are black is a coincidence, or itâ€™s probably just discrimination.</p>

<p>Even further, iâ€™d say that the error started when we disregarded trophy Lysenkoâ€™s research. Yes, yeah, that that excellent, and shown again and again to be accurate. The the peopleâ€™s geneticist essentially proved that genes are counterrevolutionary. And by assigning to them the status of being the sole proprietors of heredity, we are privileging them. We are creating a hierarchy of heritability. Weâ€™re saying that genes are like an aristocracy, that they have a monopoly over heritability. And if we disprivilege for genes, and we have a glorious, egalitarian heritability system where every part of a cell can equally participate in Heritability, then we know, obviously, then the environment is all that matters.</p>

<p>I find myself particularly convinced of an academic viewpoint if those who disagree with it have to be killed. I find, I find the fact that people disagree with it have to be killed is just proof positive, that that it must be right, that it must be empirically accurate. In the words of Angela Saini, what makes us who we are is the content of our characters. And this is entirely in our own hands right now.</p>
