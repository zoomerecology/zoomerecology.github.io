I"<p>Do you think Britain has a better chance of being saved versus Sweden or France?</p>

<p>Versus Sweden, yes. Sweden has death wish and wants to destroy itself, that’s quite clear. Versus France, no, they’re quite ethnocentric, of the french. So, I don’t know, what do you think?</p>

<p>I’d say France, Britain, Sweden in that order. You mean, France will base them up most sort of, uh, you know, likely to experience some kind of severe demographic problem in the future, which is Sweden. Sweden First. Sweden would be very high up, on the list of countries that’s likely to go through a white shift, to use kaufman’s term. Yeah. But why do you think France is doing better than us? Probably for the reasons you just outlined. The french are more belligerent and ethnically sort of minded. Even if you look at french leftism, it’s dripping with french ethnic sort of politics. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Yeah, I think so. I think, I think that the french are, the french Communist Party was actively, up until recently, hyper antiimmigration.</p>

<p>Yeah, well, they should be. If they swap the workers, then, by definition, they should be antiimmigration. The economic theory of supply and demand, right? It’s basic. It’s a very basic thing. If you support the workers, then, if you read the stuff by Turchin or whatever, you support the world. Because you must be antiimmigration. You can’t not be antiimmigration. You must keep the population as small as possible if you want to high wages for the workers.</p>
