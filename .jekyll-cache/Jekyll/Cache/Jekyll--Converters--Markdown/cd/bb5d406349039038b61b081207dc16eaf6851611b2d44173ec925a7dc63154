I"(<p>Hereditary monarchy or elected monarchy? Which is better?</p>

<p>Perhaps a combination of the two. So, hereditary monarchy, but with an element of a kind of Witan that makes sure that if the monarchy has any power, then nobody particularly stupid gets into power. That’s what they have in a lot of muslim countries. So there’s, this is what the anglosaxons used to do as well, I think some extent as well. So, and I think it’s also what the norse used to do, that it that there is a hereditary monarchy, but it’s, it’s one of the sons of the current king, or whatever. But the question is, who?</p>

<p>I quite like the idea of some very into the Holy Roman empire. So essentially what you have is you have the ability for power to concentrate in the hands of a nobility who are responsible for electing a new monarch. When one of three happens, the monarchical line fails. So if it dies without issue, for whatever reason, it can’t carry on. So you need to basically find a new family. This prevents, prevents into dynastic struggle. So create peace, right? It would mitigate against civil war. The second thing this would achieve is it would also be a way moving a mark who starts acting up and abusing what would ideally be a lot of power that they’d have.</p>

<p>And three, it would also be a way of removing a monarch who was just plain incompetent. So one who wasn’t, sort of malicious, but just dumb, like some of these habsburgs who ended up, um, becoming so inbred that their jaws and noses Tip, nose tips for joining, and they couldn’t without druling and all this, you know, absolute horrible. What was it Charles v of Spain? He was, he was invalid, basically. He had the iq of a fiveyearold. He was an absolute, just a walking show of mutations. And he had no business sitting on that throne.</p>
