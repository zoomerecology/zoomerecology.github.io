<p>Bbc Sami. Are there indigenous people in the Eu? So they need protection? Does that make scandinavians, germanics, celts or slavs, space aliens?</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know what definition makes something in someone indigenous. Apparently itâ€™s that they got there first and that they never, I guess itâ€™s that they never adopted. For agriculture. Iâ€™m all full agriculture. I guess that must be the definition of, that must be what they mean by indigenous. I canâ€™t see how it could be anything else. Indigenous is hunter gatherers, or people that have somehow, I donâ€™t know. What do you think, whatâ€™s indigenous mean?</p>

<p>Well, Iâ€™ve always taken indigenous to mean the populations that settled a particular region first and are still extant or coextant in that region. So for example, you could say that in the Uk. Itâ€™s basically the original celtic and anglo peoples, who are the indigenous peoples of the United Kingdom. Whereas in somewhere like Canada, youâ€™re looking at youâ€™re looking at the europeans being a settler people. Whereas the indigenous people are a local sort of amerindian, arctic people grouping, some ammo Indians.</p>

<p>Should we go back further? Shouldnâ€™t we argue that the anglosaxons came after the celts, and so the celts are indigenous, more indigenous than the anglosaxons?</p>

<p>Well, yes, you could. You could actually argue that celts are more indigenous to the United Kingdom than the anglosaxons. And maybe you get a similar thing in the case of Sweden, where you have a very, very old population up there of essentially amerindianoid type people, the Sami, and then you have the same with finland as well. I mean, you have these more recent, more caucasian people who came a little bit later on, but still have been there for many millennia.</p>

<p>So thereâ€™s a subjective political thing to it. They would probably say no, the finns arenâ€™t indigenous. The finns, the finns, you know, the finns have always had immigrants. Thatâ€™s what they say. But the Sami has to be preserved. Theyâ€™re indigenous. They have this, they have this mantle of indigenousness. And have to have a sami parliament, which is basically a talking shop. And you are sami by by ethnicity. You canâ€™t just become sami. That you are allowed to be sami by law in finland, by virtue of having a sami grandparent, I think, or great grandparent.</p>

<p>Well, thatâ€™s an artifact of having a sort of double standard.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a double stance. They would say that finns, no, no, you to be finished if you move here from Somalia and you get a finished path for your finish. But then then these indigenous people, these armies, know, youâ€™ve got to be itâ€™s a racial thing.</p>
