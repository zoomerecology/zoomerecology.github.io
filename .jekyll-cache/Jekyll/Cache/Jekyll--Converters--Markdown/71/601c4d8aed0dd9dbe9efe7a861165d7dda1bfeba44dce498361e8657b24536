I"i<p>Stephen Chu avoided the leftist outrage mob, despite doing so much research on genes and intelligence? His wikipedia page has no mention of academic racism or any other buzzwords, despite his contributions to hbd. Far from it. He seems to have very high status and rank in the field of academics.</p>

<p>I don’t know, he’s a slippery sort of person. He’s managed to evade controversy probably because he hasn’t really, he hasn’t really overtly talked about or addressed the more controversial aspects of our field in. I think his, his thinking has always been keeping it more on the respectable side by focusing on the sort of the cognitive genetics and the, you know, the applications of this technology, that sort of thing. So I think that’s his modus operandi, and I think that’s why he generally avoids controversy. He sort of keeps on the respectable side of things, you know, just about. Although whether where that respectable side is varies from time to time. You know, it can be one moment the left to find with you doing work on on, you know, group differences. In the next minute, they’ve decided it’s the worst thing ever. So it can vary. So it’s not necessarily a safe position to be in the long term.</p>

<p>I mean, Richard, who played poorly in eastenders about 15 years ago, got in trouble for using the word oriental. And and since then, the word oriental students have become more acceptable again. So you never know where you are. That’s the whole point of it. Keep you on your toes, constantly move the goal post, so you know what you’re doing. And therefore you just shut up and let them debate and try.</p>

<p>I will say this, Steve is doing excellent work. Um, I wish him the very best, and I hope that he never has a serious controversy or any serious problem of any kind, because he’s a very valuable asset to the field. Good. Okay, so</p>
