I"Œ<p>Is there a significant average difference phenotypically, between interracial people with white mothers versus those white fathers?</p>

<p>In terms of personality, I can talk, iâ€™ve read about this, if itâ€™s a black father and a white mother, then the the the child will be higher. Sort of our strategy, basically. And, behavioral problems, headaches and various physical problems. If itâ€™s the other way around, then no problems, really, not least not behavioral problems.</p>

<p>In theory, you should be able to test this stuff using global admixture analysis. So thatâ€™s where you actually take, using biogeographical ancestry markers, you can work out the degree to which an individual is at mixed, so whether theyâ€™re, you know, purely european or, say, purely african. And then you have every sort of blend in between, essentially, which you can measure as a continuous variable using biogeographical ancestry markers, actually using genetic indicators. And and you want to see if the relationship between these markers is linear with respect to the trait of interest, or quadratic. Because if you think about it, a quadratic relationship, both positive and negative. So a negative quadratic relationship, negatively signed quadratic relationship is one which it arcs up and then down, so itâ€™s positively accelerated, then negatively accelerated. A positively signed quadratic relationship is a ushaped relationship with an inverse U. And, if you can fit quadratic distributions to admixture as a function of level of trait of interest, like, say, iq, then you have indications of inbreeding, sorry, indications of outbreaking vigor, you know, hybrid vigor, or out breeding depression. In the case of a trait like Iq, or cranial sort of structure, or height. You know, heâ€™s all been studied using a global admixture analysis. The relationships are purely linear. But thatâ€™s not to say that for all traits thatâ€™s going to be true. For some traits, it might be, thereâ€™s a real advantage to mixing up these these ancestral markers. It might be those intermediary have, you know, very elevated levels of that trait, right? Versus those who are highly one or highly the other. So, you know, as purely one or purely the other. Or it might be this out breeding depression for certain traits, where you actually have an exaggeratedly low level of that trait as a function of being of intermediate admixture. And this is something that really needs to be studied, and itâ€™s very important.</p>

<p>People who are from North Africa, who take Egypt or whatever, who tend to combine being, sort of arab caucasian, basically, with black hand mixture, those people tend to be very good at middle distance running. Yes, this is an example of a trait where you have hybrid vigour. I remember a program, which was part which came out many years ago, and I met, I remember it because thereâ€™s a famous bbc, uh, correspondent as a chap, who sort of goes out and interviews people. Iâ€™m completely banking on his name, but he interviewed Phil Rushton and Linda Gomfordson for this program. And they were both on one of the episodes. One of the episodes was actually based on, it was race and IQ, came out on the Bbc. It was amazing. And to try and be balanced. They actually interviewed, uh, they, they interviewed, you know, hereditarians, in addition to James Flynn an environmentalist, essentially. So itâ€™s quite, quite well balanced, actually. But the, but one of the episodes they had on on this was, and I think the chap who presented it was, was mixed race himself, so therefore he was, you know, he stated from the up front, but he was personally sort of invested in this and had a personal interest in this, and this is why he decided to make these documentaries. So I do apologize, Iâ€™m completely blanking on the name of the so maybe these are on youtube or something. But, well, worth watching. Theyâ€™re quite interesting. But the, but one of the episodes was about possible, sort of hybrid vigor that can stem from certain forms of admixture. And they talk about middle distance running. That was one of the things that was discussed in the program. And also, physical appearance. There were, there was some discussion of, you know, how this affects physical appearance and sort of levels of perceived attractiveness and things like that. Now, again, this is a lot of stuff was based on anecdotes. And a lot of the scientists were interviewed in this program saying, well, you know, it could be this way, it could be that way. But if you, if you did global admixture analysis, you could actually test this comprehensively, just by fitting those different form functions to the data. It would be incredibly easy to do.</p>
