I"<p>Will very religious christians out breed the atheists? Whatever projections for amish, mormons, catholics, etc, in Ano Domini 2100.</p>

<p>I don’t know the projections, but it’s almost certain that christians are going to outbreed atheists, because the fertility differentials are absolutely massive. And true for any religious individual of any denomination. Religiosity seems to have these very pronounced natalism.</p>

<p>What is our view on eric kaufman’s work?</p>

<p>Kaufman wrote this book <em>shall the religious inherit the earth</em>. I did a paper a few years ago with Helmut Nyborg and Lee Ellis and a couple of other people, and, we showed this comprehensively with a large data set, that absolutely, the religious will inherit the earth. They will. I mean, it’s impossible for them not to that. They have so many more children than the nonreligious, than the atheists. It’s undoubtedly true that they will, they will inherit the Earth.</p>

<p>Don’t forget gerhard mysenburg, he put out a paper in which he also produced these projections showing religiosity growing as a function of fertility differentials using a world valued survey.</p>

<p>Everyone overlooks our stress levels go down because of the industrial revolution, and this makes us, less religious. It means that our stress levels drop below a certain point. Religiousness is associated with stress. The more stressed you are, the more religious you become. Society becomes less religious gradually. But while that’s happening, while we are becoming less religious at the environmental level, it’s co-occurrence, we are becoming more religious at the genetic level. And eventually there reaches a point where the differential is such that that religiousness pokes through, and we start to become more religious. Even though stress levels are still declining. I think this is potentially, and then what will probably happen, of course, is the stress levels will go up, because religiousness is associated with ethnocentrism, an ethnocentric behavior. So it’s more likely to underpin things like ethnic conflict and to elevate, perhaps, ethnic conflict.</p>

<p>You’ve got, of course, this idea of the spiteful mutations, and how one of these would probably be atheism, and it would help to undermine religiousness. And so assuming the the power of that, the influence of that spiteful, these growing spiteful mutations, of course, don’t tend to have children, and of course, kind of influence people to not be religious and does not have many children, as long as that’s outweighed, then their religions will rise, I think, with the differential, breeding patterns with Muslims, with religious muslims, are very high. It’s like five kids. So I would suspect that we, we can expect a more religious future.</p>

<p>Eric kaufman, of course, predict this in his book, that we will, we will become, I think it’s very probable. And particularly if that the levels of innovation go down, all of these markers of intelligence are going down. Intelligence is also negatively associated, negatively correlated with Iq. Is negatively quality with religiousness. So if Iq is going down, we should become more religious for that reason as well.</p>

<p>So, it’s likely that the future is religion is going to make a return in some form. Although Christians do have higher breeding than than atheists, Christianity been so kind of, sort of humiliated, almost, hasn’t it? It’s been so sort of debased.</p>

<p>The vitality and vigor of any given religion is going to be a function of a degree to which it is embedded within a society that is undergoing very, very strong group selection. Because, don’t forget, religion is an adaptation to group selection. This was D.S. Wilson’s argument he put forward in Darwin’s cathedral. But it solves the free-riding problem, but it makes a virtue out of ethnocentrism, martyrdom, Selfsacrifice, etc, um. And it provides people with existential meaning, or monumentalist meaning, in their lives, such that they are happy toiling, because they know ultimately there is a greater good that is being served in so do reflected through the success of your nation, which is in turn a reflection on the glory of your God.</p>

<p>And <strong>if the society is falling apart through a regime of chronic, persistent, individual level selection, as we are living through at the moment</strong>, the religious institutions will change to adapt to that reality. They will become pushers of whatever fashionable bromites are going, they will drop, or the group selected trappings of the religion that sort of retreat from their basic function.</p>

<p>Essentially, it’s not those types of religious people that are breeding heavily. Oh yeah, that’s right. It’s, it’s people who are old style, old book type religion are being selected for. Religious is 40 genetic and religiousness has a fertility advantage as well. It’s something that’s been a selectable in itself, rather than simply a bundle of things that have been selected for come together as religion. And I argue that we were selected for, this very specific form of religiosity, for a moral god whom we whom we worship collectively. And it seems that deviations from that are what associated with low fertility, and holding to that associated with high fertility.</p>
