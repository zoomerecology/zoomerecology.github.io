I"Ñ<p>Research on antiwhiteness among whites.</p>

<p>Well, people have been looking at it. It seems that in America itâ€™s a uniquely leftwing thing, because rightwing whites, or whites who are lean republicans, described as conservative, actually have slightly positive views of their own ethnicity, which, by the way, is in line with the self general above average level of ethnic selfregard that you find among every other group. The only group that stands out, which has negative ethnic selfregard leftwing whites, so Democrat supporters and things like that. So it seems that thereâ€™s something about the ideologies espoused by specifically leftist whites that make them tend towards negative self ethnocentrism.</p>
