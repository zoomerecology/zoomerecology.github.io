I".<p>I just wanted to say something about the christianity and consanguinity. Yes, there does seem to be an association there. And yes, it does seem to be the case that the spread of christianity significantly attenuated, uh, the practice of consanguinity, although it might not have had equal effect across, uh, across different regions. You get, you gave the example of Sardinia. Maybe it wasn’t as effective there for local reasons related to heightened parasite stress, perhaps.</p>

<p>Where was that published?</p>

<p>There were quite a few instances about actually, Kevin Mcdonald published the first theoretical studies in 2001 in politics and life sciences. And a large paper which essentially confirmed his model, but didn’t cite him, by Schultz et el, was published in science earlier this year.</p>
