I"<p>What do you gentlemen think of birth order effects? Do you agree with the arguments birth order effects made by slate star Codex?</p>

<p>Don’t know what slate star codex is, but there is some evidence for birth order effects, yes. For example, in sexuality, the more older brothers you have, according to a paper I read by Ray Blanchard, the increases every old brother increases the likelihood that you’ll be gay by about point three. So, so a gayness is a birth order effect. Other birth order effects seem to include, differences in physical height, things like this. Basically feminist boys become more feminine as they becomes they have more older brothers. So there are birth order effects, as far as I can see, yes, because of changes in the hormonal balances of the mother and things like this.</p>

<p>Birth order effects? No, yes, they’re, well, they’re real. But the question I have is the degree to which they might be confounded with measures of fertility. For example, there’s a birth order effect on iq. And people say that younger children are actually, uh, younger children are the younger born lower iq. Well, one possibility is that there’s a birth order effect. So something, something happens as a result of your position in a family that leads to you getting state fewer resources because of discriminative parental fatigue in older offspring. Perhaps the older, younger ones are sort of surpluses, essentially. So that’s one explanation. Another more plausible explanation is that, if you have a higher birth organ, you come from a bigger family. Bigger families go with lower iq because there are negative associations between iq and fertility. Therefore, it’s an ipso facto dysgenic effect. So that needs to be better controlled in these birth order studies.</p>
