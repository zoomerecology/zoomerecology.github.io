I"Ì<p>If Iq goes down, and civilization goes backwards, whatâ€™s going to happen apropo looking after nuclear power stations?</p>

<p>Well, looking after the nuclear power stations will look after themselves, in the sense that theyâ€™ll just stop working after a while. The problem will be dealing with all the radioactive nasties inside of them and all the wastes that theyâ€™ve produced that. Because really, you have people to deal with that, yes.</p>

<p>I remember a very pessimistic geologist, a very brilliant geologist who I knew when I was an undergraduate, who had this idea, whoâ€™s one of these people who never came to terms with global warming. So he was one of these people who still thought things were going to get a lot cooler. So he was a sort of global cooling person. He thought temperatures were going to drop, and we were going to end up in an ice age. And he said, well, one of the things this sort of wreckage of civilization can do when itâ€™s in the ice age to come is they can dig these great, big wells that they can sort of put into the ground, and they can take these bits of radioactive metal, these highly radioactive metals and things and put them at the bottom of the well. And the radiation coming out of the the metals would heat the air and cause sort of convection. So youâ€™d have all this hot, nonradioactive air coming out of the well, and you could sort of sit around the well warming your, you know, warming your tootsies, essentially.</p>

<p>And I pointed out to him, thereâ€™s one little flaw with his idea. He said, whatâ€™s that? And I said, if you look into the well, youâ€™re a curious child, you sort of get a pedestal or something, and stand on it and look over, well, then you are going to be blasted in the face with huge amounts of radiation. He said, ah, well, they just have to build the walls really tall to stop that from happening. This, he seemed to think that the nuclear waste could be made into an asset if we degenerated enough.</p>
