I"#<p>Dollars? Do you expect an economic collapse with one of the first problems of g decline? I take it you’re very bearish on stocks long term. I don’t know what you mean by bearish. What do you know what that means?</p>

<p>Yes, well, they’re bullish and bearish. Are these two sort of positions you can take in the market. And, bullish means you’re sort of growth confident, and bearish means your stagnation confidence, or even decline confidence. So if you’re bearish, it means you’re more likely to want to do a lot of short selling, and you’re more likely to want to do a lot of sort of hedging. Whereas if you’re bullish, you’re more likely to want to, you know, be on the buy side. And, uh, and sort of riding out the bubble and all this sort of thing, and getting more and more value and just accumulating as much and then selling it off.</p>

<p>Are you bullish or bearish?</p>

<p>I’m generally bearish. I i always think the bearish position in the world, historical context, is the one to take, because I think a lot of what drives economic growth is extremely ephemeral and transient, and it’s restricted really to the last couple of centuries. We just haven’t had this sort of massive economic growth. If you look at, angus madison and other historians of economics. But you you look at a, you look at historical growth patterns in economics, you can see most of human history, economic growth was very, very restricted. It was very limited. It started to sharply inflect, really around the time of the industrial revolution, and sort of kept going ever since then. So whatever’s driving it, in world historical terms, is very transient, and it’s very likely to to reverse itself. And I suspect that the more instances of antiflynn effects we see, the more likely we are to start to see the beginnings of a genuine reversal in economic growth. Because there’s now quite a lot of literature, including papers that i’ve written, uh, which show that the biggest predictor of economic growth in countries is the rate of the flynn effect.</p>
