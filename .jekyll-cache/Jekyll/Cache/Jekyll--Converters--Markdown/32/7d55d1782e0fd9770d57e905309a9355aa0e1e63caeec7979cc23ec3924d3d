I"E<p>Says, uh, does pedophilia indicate the presence of satanism?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m aware of data that would link, um, being extreme, to some extent, being extremely religious, with our nonnormal sexuality. There is, there is obviously data on that. So homosexual males, sorry, people that become people, homosexual males are much more religious than heterosexual males or heterosexual women.</p>

<p>Satanism equals selfishness, his highest value. So therefore heâ€™s saying yes. I mean, iâ€™d say yes in in the sense that, you see, some of these very elite satanists, clearly had interests in that direction, which might be consistent with the spiteful mutation theory. So there could be a sort of general factor of deviance which exists among these mutants. So these these, uh, people who embrace these malevolent sort of strains of religion may well also want to practice generally deviant and sort of chaos enhancing or inducing forms of sexuality. So itâ€™s possible that there could be an association between the two</p>

<p>The people that are going to deviate from the model, from the normal religious model, if thatâ€™s underpinned, as you say, by being mutants. Those mutants were more likely to be found at the top of society. They would be mutant by virtue of being of higher social status. Theyâ€™d be more likely to carry these kinds of mutations because theyâ€™ve been under under darwinian selection less recently. Um, equally, if they were mutant inter that would imply theyâ€™d be more likely, perhaps, to be mutant in terms of, certain sexual proclivities.</p>

<p>If we take satanism and define it very broadly. So the people that would be accused of satanism or witchcraft or whatever, as I discussed in a video some weeks ago, tended to be these malcontents, these people that everybody hated. The women that was burned in manningham in essex, the first victim of matthew hopkins. She was this, she was called something, Elizabeth Clark, I think her name was. And she had one leg, and she was a widow, and everyone hated her, and she was just a thoroughly nasty person. And so, and so it was horrible. Everybody went around cursing people and all this kind of thing. And so it followed from that that she ended up being accused of witchcraft, and thatâ€™s what started the witch fighter generalâ€™s system, which ended up hanging 100 people in in East Anglia, so in around 1645. So, yeah, so in that sense, you could argue that it what correlates with, you the two could go together. I looked at another video at this.</p>

<p>Pedophilia, in terms of having sex with children and things like this, tends to be associated with very low iq for some reason. Whereas, where, whereas with those where itâ€™s, itâ€™s whatâ€™s been in the news recently about Jeffrey epstein and whatever the what is it the term Ebaphiles, I think thatâ€™s the term hebahpiles. So where theyâ€™re interested in pubescent, but underage, then thatâ€™s that doesnâ€™t have that same association. That could kind of make sense some of the associate, some of the correlates of that, such as psychopathic personality, and could potentially help you to rise up high.</p>

<p>Okay, so I think in general the basic point here is, yes, if youâ€™re going to be deviant in one way, you might be deviant in other ways as well. So in so far as the uh sort of transient property here is a desire to violate norms and conventions which may exist in so far as the such norms and conventions are basically purpose towards maintaining group fitness, then yes, you could get all these deviants wanting to do all these deviant things in multiple different domains of deviancy.</p>
