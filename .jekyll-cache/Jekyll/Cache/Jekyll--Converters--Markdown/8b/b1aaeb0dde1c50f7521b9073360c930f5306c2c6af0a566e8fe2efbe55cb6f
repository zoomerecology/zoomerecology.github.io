I"<p>Nature vs nurture is a false dichotomy. I know Gaulton, brilliant man, came up with this distinction, but the reality is there is not one without and a lot of what we think are the environmental effects on traits are really just, there are biological mechanisms of preparedness and plasticity, as defined by Mary West Eberhard and other evolutionary developmental theorists, which undergird how individual organisms respond to their environments, in terms of the way in which gene environment interactions and gene environment covariances affect patterns of development.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s social epistasis effects, which which gene, individual genome times, social genome moderation effects, um, which which also relate to biological mechanisms of preparedness and plasticity. And ultimately, it’s these mechanisms which affect the way in which organisms interact with their environment. And the nature and nurture thing is is a false dichotomy. It really is. Think about it in terms of biological preparedness versus plasticity</p>
