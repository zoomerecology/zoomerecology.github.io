I"ë	<p>What about a eugenics program in an environment of group selection and rising g, that is high g, and group selected people genetically modifying their offspring? Would that not have an amplifying effect civilization?</p>

<p>Well, under those conditions? Um, yes, it probably would. Because, as iâ€™ve mentioned before, you would have a situation in which the society would be organized in such a way both the cultural and the sort of epigenetic control levels. Culture is is epigenetics. Itâ€™s a form of heredity which exists outside of genes, but is parallel to genes. So itâ€™s a form of epigenetic inheritance. Youâ€™d have epi, youâ€™d have the right epigenetic controls, essentially to encourage people to make group selected choices. Under such a, under such a situation, I donâ€™t think it would be individuals who made the choices. It would actually be, it would actually be a more hierarchical decisionmaking process, involving consultation with people in society more broadly. And thereâ€™d be certain forms of sort of organization there which would function to regulate this, and these organizations would be they would, they would basically put the interests of the group front and, you know, front and foremost in their, calculations concerning the desirability of certain changes, etc.</p>

<p>And overall, such a civilization would probably be more receptive to hereditarian sort of accounts of human nature, and also to policy, which, which could evolve from the findings of that field and be used to form the basis of policy. And what such a society would look like is actually very difficult to say, because we havenâ€™t had any examples of this in the past. Weâ€™ve never had an example of a society thatâ€™s been biologically advanced in the way that we are, ie, in terms of our knowledge base and our understanding, yet has simultaneously been under strong group selection. Weâ€™ve seen examples of group selected societies, both leftist and rightist, where there seems to be very strong folk notions of what is good for the what is good for the group, and whatâ€™s not. Maybe China will be the first, or Russia. Who knows?</p>

<p>Maybe in the future we will see examples of this with China and possibly Russia, who knows? I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much potential for this in the west, although I could be wrong. Someone noted that in Russia, they openly talk about the in russian universities, they openly talk about things like race and iq despite not being familiar with with the uptodate research on it.</p>
