How can next cycle will rise higher without being able to rely on the sequestered solar energy of fossil fuels? What energetic and thermodynamic basis? 

I don't think we're anywhere close to exhausting the totality of the world's fossil fuel Reserve. I think there'd be plenty left over for next time. It might be just a little bit difficult to get to some of the oil reserves or gas reserves. It might also be that we have to be a little bit more reliant on coal and wood, and wood gas for longer than we'd like. Essentially, it might also be the case that we have to really aggressively, start taking up nuclear technologies as soon as they become possible.

If we are lucky enough to continue rising intelligence, be able to crack fusion, which is something we're not even, we're not even close to being able to do at the moment. Unfortunately, despite what a lot of hyper sensationalized press reporting is suggesting, we're not going to crack fusion anytime soon. We're not going see it in my lifetime. By fusion, I mean controlled fusion reactions of a sort that can actually be used to produce heat, to boil steam, to generate, you know, to generate electricity. I'm not talking about detonating a hydrogen bomb, obviously.
