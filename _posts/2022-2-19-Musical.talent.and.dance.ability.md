Thoughts on musicians of different genres and their level of intelligence. Does becoming good at musicals require high, high g?

my understanding from spearman was that it was quite a highly gloaded. Yes, I seem to remember a matrix that had a high general correlation. 

My understanding is that people that are good at music are often good maths. They do tend to be highly intelligent. It's a system you have to learn. It's a system of notation that has to be learnt. A pitch discrimination, that was it itself as well. Playing by ear was found to be highly associated with G. So music, uh, was associated with maths at point seven. So if we see maths as as pretty much the best marker of intelligence, it was associated with 0.7 music with, maths, 0.66 with pitch, and what else? 0.78 with classics. So basically, you do have to be intelligent music. 

In terms of actual musical ability, there's sort of two distinct scales that have been developed. There's a thing called the musicality quotient. And the musicality quotient seems to positively correlate with iq. So I believe this just measures general aptitude across a range of different instruments and performance modes, so singing, that sort of thing. Although there are differences in iq among different types of instrumentalists and also between singers and instrumentalists, I believe singers actually have, on average, higher iq than instrumentalists. And I believe that among instrumentalists, and precisely no one is going to be surprised by what I'm about to say, but I believe it's drummers who have the lowest iq. And this is based on some work guy Madison has done.

But there's another type of measure of musical aptitude, which is called the rhythmicity quotient. And the rhythmicity quotient measures rhythm ability, as distinct from musicality. So the ability to sort of detect and maintain or generate rhythm. And that's negatively associated with iq, just as dancing ability is also negatively associated with Iq. 

Really, because you think that as children grow and their brains grow, their fine motor skills and whatever become better. No, apparently there's some kind of topdown inhibition effect that takes place with dancing. You can overthink it, and as a result you can kind of, you know, flop around and not do a particularly good job of dancing. 

So you'd expect racial groups that had, as it were, natural rhythm to have lower iq. Yes, that that is what has been found. That association has been noted by Richard Lynn, actually, in one of his books. But fluctuating asymmetry positively correlates with dance ability. And there was a paper published some years ago which allowed to have some fabricated data in it. So it was sort of partially retracted, but not quite, because they were able to save the paper with the reanalysis of the original data. It had Bob Trivvers on it. Who kicked up quite a stink about it.

So you're saying the ugly people are better at dancing? Yeah. He looked at, he looked at fluctuating in that group that he led, looked at fluctuating asymmetry among Caribbean dancers, and then looked at sort of other rated dance abilities, so how others perceived the dance. And they found that fluctuating asymmetry, measured using bilateral symmetrical markers. And the variance and deviation from the midline is a tricky thing to measure, but there are a variety of different protocols for doing this, correlated negatively with danceability. So more symmetric people were better dancers. But we also know from other data that higher Iq people are worse dancers. And there's two studies which show that Iq is negatively correlated with danceability in the region of around point two. I actually have a study on this, which hasn't been published, but we found it using selfrated dance ability in the creative achievement questionnaire among a swedish sample, that was negatively correlated with a ravenslike test, in the region of negative point two. I've seen it elsewhere as well in one other study. So it's been replicated twice. 

The interesting thing about it is that what this suggests is that, opposingly, signed association suggests that it's consistent with the idea that most of what fluctuating asymmetry is, insofar as it relates to underlying genetic, your underlying genetic instability, essentially is not related to iq. So these might be common variants that cause small things to go wrong during development, but against which Iq is quite well canalized.
