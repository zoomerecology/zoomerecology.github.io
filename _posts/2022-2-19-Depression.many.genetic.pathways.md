You have an opinion or knowledge on the short or long term side effects of Accutane, the acne medication? Um, such as depression? I have no opinion on that. I'm only informed that that acne medication can lead to depression.

I, like you, I have heard the i've heard the claim that the medication uh might cause depression. The thing is, ultimately, with a lot about depression we don't understand in terms of the genes, in the gene environment interactions that predispose individuals towards depression, one thing we do know about it is it has very low heritability, we're compared to other psychobehavioral abnormalities, which suggests that it's a disease associated with many different pathways that can basically lead to a depression type type phenotype. That that is what is implied essentially by the low heritability, it suggests a lot of environmentality. By which I mean things in the environment can set up can create risks towards developing the traits, but mark that are not necessarily captured purely by environmentalists. 

Things go wrong because of a lack of myelin in the brain. If you're born early, the brain is insufficiently developed, um. And then there are many, other, uh, conditions like that, things that go on very early in life. Uh, bother, having too much of certain hormones, things like this, that can that can make predisposed towards it, and all kinds of other facts. So yes, we don't know much about but it's one thing that's always surprised me is the doctors will hand out these all medications like sweeties, and they never say to people, or they very rarely say to people, all, all medications have side effects. And nobody to read if they get medication. I know, I don't the the massive list of side effects entirely writing, which is normally everything that can go wrong could go wrong, you know, everything. Yeah, you could die. I mean, it is but there are no, of course, you're not going to read that, a because it's written entirely writing, and there's too much of it. And b, because they just don't want to know. But all medication is potentially going to have some kind of side effect. I mean, even like anything.
