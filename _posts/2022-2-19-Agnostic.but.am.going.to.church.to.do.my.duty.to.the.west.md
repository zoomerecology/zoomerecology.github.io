I am agnostic, but have been going to church recently to do my part for the west. Good boy. Um, how how does a nonbeliever become a christian for the sake of society?

I'm guessing you need to get yourself a nice christian girl, and then allow her to keep moaning at you and going on at you until you just give in and accept Christ in your life. That would be one option. There are lots of people that have become christian for that purpose. When I did my field work, I found that was the case. It was often a, there's actually a term for it in the sociology of religion. It's called flirty fishing. Um, where where a woman, kind of a good looking young christian girl is with good skin and whatever, as they tend to have, and the mutational load is sent out to kind of reel a chap in and and he and and bond him with the group and attach him to the group. And thus he converts, kind of for the induces in himself, if you like, a religious experience, for the sake of her. She never actually gets together, of course, they remain just good friends, but it does get him into the group. So, that may be a path.
