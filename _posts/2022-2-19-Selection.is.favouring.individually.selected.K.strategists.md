Who has higher fertility? The group, or individually selected people in the Uk and the Usa? 

It's k strategy that predicts in in Sweden, anyway. And that's probably in the Uk. And the Usa, it's k strategy, and therefore something closer to group selection, I suppose, in certain ways that predicts a fertility, and it's r strategy, which is much more individualistic, which predicts low fertility. So I suppose we would say it's the people that are more group selected that are breeding on that indicator?

I don't think so. I i think that the high K strategy morph that is being selected is actually particularly individually selected. 

What about the religion? The religiousness predicts fertility, and their group selected aren't they? Life history strategy, particularly among the high K end essentially is is branchy. And people with slow life histories are differentiated behaviorally. So there might be some morphs which are group selected, and there are likely morphs which are highly individually selected. And it's probable that you have a mixture of both. But I suspect the ones and this obviously, is something needs to be tested, but my suspicion is that **those who are undergoing the fertility boom at the moment are the ones who are probably highly individually selected**. And these would be ones who are adapted to sort of *fitting into societal micro niches and sort of conforming to structures around them*. 

This would be among people with slow life histories. I don't think they're particularly group selected. What about the fact that religiousness predicts, fertility? Well, I don't know if the religiousness that people profess today is particularly group selected. I mean, have you heard any particularly fiery, group selected anglican sermons of late? But they're nothing they're dying out there. Yes, but they're the mainline religion in in Britain. And then you have protesters, who are not much better, who are the mainline religion virtually everywhere else in the west. The less said about the catholics, the better at this stage, their mutated religion. 

But the ones that are breeding above replacement fertility, if you've got the muslims, the mormons. Ah, you're talking. Okay, well, there are. Okay, I thought we were talking about just europeans, right? Well, if you then this two between group comparisons, yes, I think you're looking at, I think you're looking at very strong selection for group selected traits among um, among noneuropean people, especially noneuropean people who are sharing nations with european people. 

But also, the mormons are doing well. And the amish, the ones, because they have preserved a preindustrial lifestyle to some extent. The amish have very high rates of infant mortality. You know that? Well, good. That means they want to do under purifing selection. Based on some estimates from the 70s, well, they're all inbread, so they have appalling levels of of uh, problems because of that of mutations because of that.
