Is the draft still possible in multicultural societies? And is the west further or closer to larger scale conflict at this time? 

There areindications that we are more polarized than we have been since. The America, anyway, is more polarized than it has been since before the civil war. So yes, we are very close to conflict. Uh. And as for the draft, uh, by which, uh, this this fellow means, uh, subscription um then. Uh, I would think it would be very, very difficult because, a, there'd be a lot of people that weren't part of the ethnic group and would object to going into the army. B, there'd be all the stuff about human rights and whatever.
