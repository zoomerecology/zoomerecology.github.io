What is your moral philosophy? Do you have a moral philosophy?

It's not really something I'm interested in, moral philosophy. I'm more just about the science. So just going wherever the data takes me. Without I find that if you have strongly held moral philosophies, you tend to get in an awful lot of trouble. So I hereby renounce all moral philosophies. There we go.

But when i've met you, you've been quite an ethical person. You've got, you seem to have quite sort of certain things which you consider to be moral, certain things that you consider to be immoral. You that seems to be, would you say, sort of day on to logical ethics. I mean, what what is the there must be something that underpins your of many ways negotiating life. I'm not a deontologist, and I'm not a utilitarian, so you probably work out what I am on the basis of the fact that I reject both of those positions.

No, not really. A moral philospher could.
