Thoughts on orthodox christianity being ethnic based as a better solution to protestant or catholic universalism Multiculturalism? 

So, it's a sustainability question that, does the more ethnically sort of rooted nature of orthodox christianity give it more staying power, more nucleation power in terms of being able to hold together civilization, than forms of christianity which embrace moral universalism, and therefore kind of tend towards multiculturalism? So in other words, orthodox christian countries should, in theory, be resistant to sort of replacement migration. In a way, you've got lithuania as Catholic and Poland as catholic. I think there's a great extent to which religiousness, in my view, acts at the evolutionary level to to substantiate evolutionary, adaptive traits and to make them more likely to be followed because it's God's will. 

And you get forms of protestantism, which therefore develop in an ethnic direction. I mean, british anglicanism used to be highly ethnocentric. And at the height of world War one, we had the archbishop of canterbury doing a, Cosmo Lang, I think his name was, doing a sermon where he was basically saying, we must kill germans. We must kill germans. Kill germans, lest we ourself be killed. Charming. 

I don't think orthodoxy is inherently more or less ethnocentric or ethnically based. I think christianity is a universalist religion. And I suppose you could argue that protestant is more purist. It's attempts to be closer, at least in theory, to what the early church was like. Addison Paul and the early church, Anderson Paul rejected the idea that christianity was an ethnic religion before saint Paul Matthew and whatever. It was an ethnic religion. It's version of the Jews, um, and he was the one that developed it into a universalist religion. Luther and calvin attempted to get back to that and to deethnicize it, to remove the pagan dimensions to it that had grown up, such as the de facto to de facto, multiple deities in the form of angels. And so perhaps it's protestantism that's the problem. And it's perhaps not not a coincidence that it's protestant countries that have been the most hit by by multiculturalism.
