How long do you think it will be before you will be prosecuted for race and intelligence science? Well, in finland, it almost happened.

They tried to, they looked into trying to prosecute tattoo Van in 2004. I think it was for simply reporting to this dreadful newspaper we have here called helsinki and samamat, that's leftist newspaper. His research with Richard Lynn. They looked into prosecuting him for it.

There was a case where, uh, they, I think they literally prosecuted, useehowo, for basically quoting, but like, not quoting it in a nice way, quoting it in a kind of slightly mocking way,  research on, ethnic differences in temperament and, um, so it's the the law is unclear. That's why I'm concerned. So it could happen. What do you think?

The law in the Uk. Is actually quite clear. Um, if you, if you are an academic who researches controversial issues like, uh, you know, race and intelligence or what have you, that's that expression or speech is protected because it is accurate. Yeah. So it's covered by specific statutes which actually protect this is why they were unable to get Kanazawa and, uh, wattson and and these others, the other brits, and Chris Brand as well. It's like they were unable to do anything other than, you know, fire them. In the case of Chris Brand, for example. Um, there's, it's not, you're not transgressing the law.

If, however, you're standing on the street corner, handing out pamphlets with certain statistics in them, or what have you, on behalf of certain prescribed british political parties, then yes, you will. You will get in trouble, and and they will make an example out of you, because the criminal justice system this country seems to have nothing better to do with this time than, you know, that do that sort of thing, at least for the time being. I'm hoping that will change.

Hang on. So, you're saying that if you express it in an academic Journal article, that's all right, yes, as a person who is an academic.

This is the thing, if you are a, you know, if your discussion on the subject is academic and you are sticking to matters of academic fact, and you are contributing, both contributing to and drawing from the academic literature, right? With a view to that sort of thing.

It's intention that's relevant as well. Internship is very relevant, yes. Because an academic who actively publishes in this area can not be said to intend to incite racial hatred. Well, maybe under certain sort of social justice definitions, they could be. And I think if Corbyn had gotten and it might have been, that we could have gotten into a situation where people like us could have gotten in a lot of trouble very quickly. Because I'm sure the law would be very flexibly applied to, you know, in such a way to shut down academic free speech, essentially. But the, but the issue was the same with ucl when we had trouble with the, with the London conference on intelligence. We had all the fake news and everything, and we, you know, we had all these these people sort of seeding fake news stories in the media. And I had to write that we had to, you know, do that big piece where we had to clear our names and everything, which was published intelligence. We just had to counter all this fake news and everything. No, there was never any talk there of of legal of us having transgressed any kind of legal, any kind of law in this country. But the question was always about, is it ethical to talk about this?

Yes, ethical. Because I get this from the University of Ohio with whom I would do something. There's nothing they can do about it, unfortunately. Um, by law, there's nothing they can do. But, they say that, they imply that my research is unethical. And normally what unethical means is that, you know, you're torturing people or whatever as part of you harming animals or something. No, I agree. It's, it's unethical to research race. That's effectively what they're saying.

My view on that would be, uh, you know, would just be, by what ethical standards do you make that claim?

Well, as I say, ethics is nonsense.
