Marxism = parasitism upon private property.
Libertarianism = Parasitism upon commons.
NeoConservatism = Parasitism upon Genes, Traditions, and Institutions.

Authoritarianism masks the underlying theft, which is why I talk not about the authority (which each sector justified) but about the thefts (which are very hard to).

Same with economics. We talk about whether they are scientific or not but we do not talk about the thefts that occur, versus the trades that would be possible under rule of law by the natural law of reciprocity.

Theft is not an opinion. “Good” is an opinion.
