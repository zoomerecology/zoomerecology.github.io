Based on recent swedish statistics, why do males with a high income have higher skills in four males when we see the opposite trend in western countries in there?

All right, do we see the opposite trend in uh, other countries? Because i've seen evidence of the same effect in the United States. The net of Iq income is positively associated with fertility. And I think that, uh, I think that the reason for this is because, basically, the income is a function, not just of iq, but other traits as well, personality traits like, uh, you know, gfp, slow like history, orientation, that sort of thing. And I think that those traits are under positive directional selection. So when you sort of control for Iq, what you're left with is necessarily something that's positively correlated with fertility. And that's why I think we're seeing this. It could be that income is more a function of slow life history, system compliance, right? Being able to adapt to a highly rulegoverned system, being able to assimilate to corporate life, that sort of thing. I think it is much more contingent upon that than it is on high iq.
