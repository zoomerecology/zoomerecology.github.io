Continuity in uh islamic society, lower iq, and the polygamy, which would raise Iq.

Inbreeding, depression and Iq in a study of 72 countries, and what was that there is no effect. After you control for sundry covariates like democratization and education and Gdp, Et cetera, Et cetera, there's actually no effect of constant national level consanguinity on national level Iq. The two seem to be independent of one another, which is which is interesting.

I think one of the reasons for this is is possibly because you wouldn't really expect the differences in the degree of consanguinity between countries where it's where the consequences been practiced, maybe for hundreds or even thousands of years, to be causal of Iq differences. In instances where the persistence of consanguineous marriage is coupled with strong purifying selection, which has been operating for such a long period of time, but it's essentially removed from the populations the most deleterious allele combinations.

So on that basis it's probable that consanguinity is not going to drive iq differences, but changes in levels of consanguinity may complement the flynn effect. This was a theory put forward by a chap called Michael Mingroni in a paper published in psychological review in 2007, and he argued that heterosis, which is the opposite of consanguinity, essentially is out breeding as opposed to inbreeding. Heterosis might raise iq, but this may actually contribute to the flynn effect. So where you have changes in levels of consensus, you may get changes in iq. But just the static differences, they don't seem to predict the differences between them. 

Would contanguity and polygamy counselling. So in Somalia, for example, they practice cons and duty, and they practice polygamy. 

Just how would polygamy cancel?

The idea is every generation, the women are only going to marry hypergamously. So they're only going to marry for the more intelligent, higher status men. So therefore the stupider men are not going to breed. Well, a lot of these harems are made up of cousins. So they're complimentary.

They are marrying cousins. But, but the stupid men are being eliminated.

Well, that's, that's true polygamy. Polygamy could be eugenic in that regard.

I mean, there seems to be a negative effect, certainly, or identifiable intelligence. But on the bradford, as I understand it, about 50 people in bradford of Pakistani. And the overwhelming majority of people with neurological problems or whatever, are um, Pakistani. And this is a consequence of inbreeding. 

It seems that across cultures, the strongest predictors of levels of both is parasite stress. And the reason for this is, in the case of consanguinity, you have a situation where, when you're inbreeding, what you're doing is, you're concentrating your coadapted gene complexes, your major histocompatibility alleles, essentially all being concentrated. And you are competing with very specific numbers of parasites, and you're racing with them in a kind of evolutionary, coevolutionary arms race. And they're trying to outwit your immune system, and you're constantly trying to adapt to deal with them, and so on and so forth. So if you inbreed, you concentrate, you prevent those allelic complexes from breaking up. If you outbreed, you lose those complexes, they'll break up, and that means your population becomes vulnerable to that parasite.

So that's why, in addition to consanguinity, you get sort of xenophobia, you get, uh, collectivism, you get, uh, you know, all these inwardlooking type traits. Like Randy Thornhill, he calls it conservative values. It's nothing of the sort really, but it's a kind of ethnocentric, ethnolinguistic centrism, essentially among populations living in high parasite stress environments. Polygamy seems to function along the similar lines. It seems to also be something that allows you to hedge your diversity in terms of the your immunological adaptations. And it has a sort of common route there with with consanguinity mediated by parasite stress. 

If the society is unstable, then it helps them to create a functioning society where people can trust each other more, because the men can be more sure that the people they're expected to relate to in some way related to them. So it's, it's, a kind of insurance policy, to some extent, against cuckholdry. In society people don't trust each other very much.
 
that's true. And, and there's also the issue of consolidation of wealth through, maximizing vertical transmission. So if you are marrying a cousin, then you're marrying into your own family's wealth, or at least another tranche of your family's wealth. And that means those wealth pots will be combined in the next generation. So it's essentially a good way of keeping money within the family. And it's a resource consolidation mechanism.
