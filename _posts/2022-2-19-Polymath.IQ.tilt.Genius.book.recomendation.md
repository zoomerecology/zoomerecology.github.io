Geniuses tend to be high in Iq tilt. What about Polymath geniuses? Why do they not follow this example, Leonardo Da Vinci? 

Is Leonardo Da Vinci not tilted. I would have thought he was tilted in a mathematical direction. Well, tilt is just one of about a dozen factors that hans Eisenk said needed to be present in basically giving rise to the phenomenon of genius. [ __, __ ] has a big checklist he goes through in his book genius, which he published in 1995.

A very good book, and i'll just plug it briefly. Is Dean Keith Simmons 2018 book, which is called the genius checklist. And it's a popular book, and it's literally just a checklist of things that are most statistically highly frequently associated with extreme levels of creative eminence, including having a parent die young, that sort of thing, or having, you know, being an older sibling, sort of interesting things like that, that you can sort of go down and see how many you score.

But the the interesting thing about the tilt thing is it's just one factor. And it might be there are many, many different ways putting together geniuses. And it might be very different ways of domain general creativity, which some of which involve sort of deep learning. So getting so far into the fundamentals of a particular field that you start to see the connections with other fields. And it's really a function of massive application and focus, tilt and ability differentiation, versus other sort of more a dilettanteesque type interest patterns, which might involve simply moving between different domains and then mixing and matching in a kind of, you know, generative, fluid, combinatorial kind of way, in an unstructured way.

So maybe that's your sort of fast life history genius versus your slow life history approach genius. Leonardo Da Vinci always struck me as someone who, based on his biography, had a, probably have somewhat fast life history. He seemed to be, fairly promiscuous. And you have children. Do you have children? Yeah, I think he did have children. Yes. Okay, right. He was also homosexual, and he had all sorts of strange interests. And he was, he was never someone who finished anything either. This is one thing that's sort of typical of people with faster life histories, is that they they tend to get really into something, and they may do that whole borderline thing where they just drop it, they lose interest in it, and they move on to something else before they complete the task.
