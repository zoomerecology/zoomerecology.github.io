There is a study that shows that exposure to western church correlates with the breakdown in kinship title generations. Have you read the study?

I have read the study. I was pointed towards the study by survive the Jive. It strikes me that a lot of what's made Europe Europe is probably genetic. It may be a coincidence, to some extent, that this has happened with the rise of christianity. Although, on the other hand, it could be argued that as a society becomes more advanced, if you look at the research by that fellow whose name I can never remember, but he's from Lebanon, Ara Nozim, or something his name is. And he's a very interesting model here. And he shows that as the society becomes more advanced, in a sense, kinship becomes a problem.

If you to create a larger polity. You have to be you have to move, you have to increase the size of the group that you regard as your group. Um, and this means creating a society of strangers, as a city, a society in which there will be no mutual there will be no obvious reciprocity to a given act, because you might not meet the person ever again, and the person might not be keen in the traditional sense, or he might be more broadly kin or whatever. And therefore you come up with the idea of a of a a loving God, of a moral god. And that moral God becomes a kind of insurance policy for reciprocity. You know that that person will will will reciprocate and will be morally good and whatever, because he believes in the same moral god as you. And so this would suppress kinship. It would make kinship less important, it would, and it would make bonds that weren't direct kinship, or were only very much broader kinship, are more important. It would allow the society to expand, to become bigger, that kind of thing. So I would think that, you you could argue that that there would be a sort of symbiotic relationship without sounding too pretentious. Whereby, on the one hand, the society that was highly intelligent, and whatever would would grow and would be adaptive if this notion of a God was produced. But on the other hand, this notion of a God would help to make that society more adaptive.
