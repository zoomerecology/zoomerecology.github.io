Says, why aren't polygamous societies the higher Iq ones? 

It goes back to rk selection, I suppose. So when you have a situation of r selection, then you will have an unstable, yet relatively easy ecology. Then you invest a great deal in sex. And so then you end up with a situation where you will have these dominant males who want lots of sex and whatever, and they'll have multiple wives. They'll be relatively low in agreeableness. They'll be relatively low in impulse control, because these things aren't really strongly selected for in the ecology. You've got to kind of live fast and die young. And so it follows that we have the same kind of system that most animals have, which is a polygamous system.

As the system becomes, harsher and more stable, then you're going to have elevation in traits such as well, intelligence, agreeableness and impulse control. And then, of course, group selection will become more relevant. As you get group selection, then there is a benefit to having the society that seems to dominate in terms of group selection. Is the society which is more internally cooperative. And so on. And you can elevate internal cooperation and lessen internal conflict by having monogamy, because it means that you don't have a large cast of men fighting all the time over the few available females. And it also means that men can trust each other more if they've got their, if they've each got their one wife who they control, or whatever, then there's less likelihood that some other man is going to try and cuck hold them, because he's got his own wife. And so this would mean that more intelligent societies would tend to move towards monogamy.
