Serotonin will be produced in the hippocampus, solidifying memories. People higher in openness, much more subject to this. This much more easily increases s abilities. 

There is a branch of personality psychology that looks at the relationship between personality factors and the endocrine system. It's interesting because there is a model of personality called the big two. So you've heard of the general factor of personality. When you can break the general factor of personality into two super traits, there's a sort of a general factor of plasticity, which is made up of high openness and high extroversion. And there is a general factor of stability, which is made up of high conscientiousness, high emotional stability, which is just the opposite of neuroticism, and high agreeableness.

And the people who believe in the big two, they don't want them to correlate into a gfp. The reality is they always do. Correlation between them is routinely around 0.45 like that. So so you have these people like colander Young and digman and others who just very hostile to the gfp. They just want there to be two sorts of factors. The interesting thing is, there are. There is some work showing that these two factors nicely track the tradeoff between  serotoninicity, and dopaminergicity. So people high on plasticity seem to be more dopaminergic, people high on sort of sensation seeking, essentially. People high on stability tend to be more serotoninergic. And it turns out, this is an argument put forward by Yannick Musek in one of his papers on the gfp. But the general factor of personalities being high on both. So people with high gfp actually they're highly serotonergic, and they're also highly dopaminergic as well. They have kind of like a balance between the two.

So it's kind of like Galen's humor theory. Remember the humoral theory of temperament? You have black sort of bile and yellow bile and phlegm and blood, and you have pragmatics and sanguines and bilius. And the idea is to have a balance between them. This was sort of Galen's gfp was being balanced across all the humans. So you can have equanimity. Well, that's kind of like what musec is saying about the gfp, is that you have to be balanced across the endocrine system in order to have this high level of this social effectiveness factor. I mean, if you're tilted in one way or the other, you're going to be high on either plasticity or stability, essentially.
