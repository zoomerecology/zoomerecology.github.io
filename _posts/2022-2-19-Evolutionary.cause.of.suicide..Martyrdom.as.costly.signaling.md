Do you think suicide, because of emotional pain or selfish reasons, is evolutionarily, or a byproduct, of selfawareness and knowing life is cause of pain?

This is interesting because, there's a chap called, what's his name, Martin Varashek, who's an intelligence researcher who actually made waves, back in the 90s, I believe it was, at the theory that linked iq, high Iq, with suicidal ideation. And his theory was based on the idea that you needed a kind of threshold level of Iq in order to be sufficiently selfaware of your own sort of existential suffering, in order to tip you over the scales, essentially, and to, you know, do the dirty deed. So, vince Sarah, you know, sorry talking about it. Martin Varashek would actually say yes. And he'd support this with evidence, that there's correlation between, high iq and, and high suicidal ideation.

But I don't actually think that's right. I think what might be going on here is, and we've got some evidence of this in Japan, actually, using regional level data, but suicidal suicidality is higher when group selection is higher. So it seems the alternative theory is that suicide is a way of of basically doing something highly altruistic for the group. So you see very extreme examples of this in the case of suicide terrorists, who are sort of, in a more parochial, tribal sense, the term group selected, or kamikaze pilots, in the case of Japan, or soldiers in times of war who commit suicide.

And then you have this idea of altruistic, pathological altruism. Yes. So this is, you know, this is Barbara Oakley's theory. And she argues depression and suicidal ideation forms of pathological altruism. So these might be mismatched forms of, or misplaced forms of group selected altruism, which are being **super normally stimulated by novel dysphoria in our environments**.

So I started to say, martyrdom. I mean, you gave the example of suicide bombers. They're, they're conceived off as martyrs. But if you think of the protestant reformation in England, let's say, okay, under Queen Mary. And you have these various people who, I mean, it's documented at the time, these various artisans and middle class people, because that's a lot of what protestants were willingly going to the stake. These these these men in their mid20s or whatever, early 20s, exactly the kind of age where you'd have soldiers laying down their lives, suicide bombers, you know, probably virgins, unmarried, literally going to the really almost like wanting to go to the stake. It was an extraordinary kind of hysteria that occurred, where they knew what they weren't supposed to say, and they'd say it, and they go to the stake. And then ultimately, of course, it was there. It was their people, the protestants, the middle class who benefited from the protestant reformation, these striver values.

Calvinism is seen as this manifestation of these striver values, but it could also be seen as something that, as Weber argues, that forces you in the direction of these of these striver values to the to the removal of these other genetic castes and their power. That's what protestantism did. And these that's what these masters were doing. So you can see that there would be a benefit to having an optimum level of people prepared to lay down their lives, either martyrdom, soldiery.

I suppose with depression and suicide, though I suppose at the group level. Could it be that if a person is such a sort of a failure that they start to feel depressed, that that there's some degree to which it would be good for there to be a mechanism for them to remove themselves?

I don't know. Could it be that under those circumstances, you're, you're really looking at a a situation in which for such a mechanism to work. You would need for there to be big fitness payoff at the end of the day, essentially for your suicidal act. This is actually theory Jay Belsky had. He hasn't published it, but he did tell me about it several years ago. And I met him a couple of years ago at Birkbeck college, before he moved over to Uc. Davis. He had this theory that there's a kind of suicide, which is not purposeful suicide. So it's not I'm going to kill myself, I'm going to die, type suicide. You know, therefore I'm going to do something horrible to myself. It's, it's basically a form of suicide which involves you just dropping dead. You know, maybe your early 50s or something. You play racquetball, you you cycle, you run, you do all the, you know, bug man sports, etc. You eat right. You you're absolutely in perfect healthy, good mental health. Sudden death. You just dropped dead.

Bit like what happened to Seth Roberts, the nutritionist, chap, who started off as a social psychologist at Uc Berkeley, and then he went on to become a nutritionist and moved over to China. He was a sort of health nut. He actually coauthored a paper with him shortly before he died. He's a very interesting fellow. He's a lefty, but he actually had these very sort of probers, charlton and pro medical hypothesis, and that whole controversy was happening. I think he was on the editorial board at the time. He's one of the few that supported charlton. He was a health nut and had all this. He came up with Shangrila diet, which turned into a New York Times Bestseller, and all this sort of thing. It just dropped dead. He was out hiking in in some province somewhere in China. Six days later.

Killing yourself? No, so you're not killing yourself. Your body is killing you. This is Jay Belski's theory was that this, this was a form of of highly altruistic dying, and that you could predict this if you looked at the sort of relative fitness of the families in which this kind of spontaneous dying happened, essentially. He argued that these sort of people, the risk factors for this, would be coming from big families. Now, that would be a genuinely interesting and high impact epidemiological study.

He did kill himself by his own hand, this person? No, he just dropped dead. This is what I'm saying. It's not suicide in the sense that you kill yourself. It's your body just stops functioning.

But that's a different thing. That's not what we're talking about.

Is it? You see, is it evolutionarily or is it really just a more extreme manifesto? I think I see your point. Now, that's a good point.

I see. I see your point, that it's a way of your body killing yourself, either physically or men physically. 

Your body destroys your mind in such a way that makes you, you know, kill yourself, right through depression or what have you, or psychosis or or your body just shuts its metabolism down, you know, very there are many ways to skin a cat, right? And if anybody in many parts lead to Rome, my the same fitness payoff accrues to having this these these genes within the population, these termination genes, essentially. And you're going to see a variety of strategies, or a variety of, you know, adaptations. 

So, there's two ways one could interpret the burnings under under Mary, in which, however many people it was, were 300 are in a population of three million, were were burned. On the on the one hand, is that by doing it, it's inspiring the group. So by having these. By having these, these figures that do this, it's inspiring the group, right? But on the other hand, it's a manifestation of the intelligence and group selectedness of the group that you have them at all. 

Here's an idea. Here's a brand new idea, okay, which you've just given me, just based on this. You're familiar with zarharvey's work on costly signaling, body of evolutionary theory. But costly signaling theory is the idea that you are, you can do certain things which which impose a cost on you, but at the same time, they advertise your hidden so the peacock's tail is the perfect example. The male peacock strut around this gordy tail, which, which would just make him very, you know, obvious predator date, essentially. But somehow he's able to to get away from predators, despite the group level.

So selection favors a tradeoff between tail length. Too long, predators will get you. If it's too short, you won't get any any peacock sex, right? Or Pee hen sex. So as a consequence, there's this perfect sort of middle ground where it's just costly enough. That's a costly signal. 

What if? What if these sorts of behaviors, **these martyrdoms, are group selected forms of costly signaling**, whether is born by the individual, or other cost is born by the entire group, because they're losing all their high priests. They're losing all their top holy men, but at the same time, what that's showing to the group with whom they are in competition is, you can, you can kill these people. We've got plenty more where they came from.

That should be pursued. That's that. Yeah, group level costly signaling. So, we've got plenty more where this comes from. It undermines the confidence of the group. And that's, in a way, it makes sense more of what these islamic groups are doing, that it's costly signaling, it. And it does undermine the confidence of the of the opposed group. And the Japanese in the war as well. Same thing. They can just throw kamikaze pilots at you. And more doing it. They're  saying, as a group you can take us on, but this is what we're going to show you we're made of. Because we're able to lose some of our best people and you still won't be able to subvert our resolve. It's as simple as that. So that, by the way, could be written up and and shown mathematically. I could easily, I could easily code up a simulation using a simple population based simulation. I could do it in five minutes. 

The person there says, i've got one of the chances the Japanese lost. Who has been invaded and who hasn't? It doesn't always have to work. Most of it can work enough of the time that it can be a viable strategy. All it is, all it has to do is fail once, right? And you're gone. So, so that's, so, that's a possibility. Yeah, it's true. Good. No, it's very it's a good question. Were the Japanese using this in wars in which they were successful historically. And our data indicates, that based on the prefecture level analysis of historical conflict in Japan and its correlates, that, yes, that probably was the case.
