We're not really in a position whereby we can actually realistically do this. I don't think we're intelligent enough to go back to the moon. Let alone go to mars. So I think you can forget that. That's just nonsense.

I think what's going to happen is, and we see it already happening, actually, is, as it becomes obvious we're beginning that we're getting less intelligent, they will start to accept that. But then it will be for environmental reasons. It will be because of pollutants. There'll be a new campaign once global warming gets boring, and they'll start to say, oh, we're becoming stupider because plastic straws. Or expressing contrary opinions to the opinions of those who have power, this makes you stupid, that would be how they'll deal with it. I guarantee it.
