That attached earlobes and lefthandedness are not fixed in populations reputational load in Africa?

It's an interesting thing. I mean, the genes which control both of those traits are clearly quite different. Left-handness is associated with testosterone. And lefthandedness is very high, for example, among the yamamoto tribe. It's like a very violent tribe, and it's about 25 lefthanded compared to.

Well, it's interesting because that interesting thing is, is that all of the candidates genes that have been identified, identified, as far as the candidate gene constitutes an identification. All the candidate genes that have been sort of candidated for lefthandedness have failed to replicate. They actually did a huge matter analysis, like a genomewide association study, and they found that the candidate genes are, basically all of them fail, every single one of them, which is fascinating. I mean, that's absolutely fascinating, because you sometimes, usually get like, one hit or something. But it turns out, it turns out we know nothing about the genetic architecture of lefthandedness.

My theory of the genetics of lefthandedness is actually, what's going on is legacies through many, many different kinds of genetic damage. So it's one of those traits which is, which is just a general indicator of something gone wrong genetically, right? So you're not going to find any candidate gene for it, because there is no gene that controls ministrality. What there are, there are genes which control symmetry, things like that. But there's tons and tons of pathways which can get messed up, which can lead to you to engaging in what's called lateralization, where you move with what is normally dominant, one hand becomes the other hand becomes dominant. That's a sort of lateralization. 

So in other words, what you might do if you did, like, a genome scan for mutations, you might find that the load of mutations is higher. And indeed, if you look at the phenotypic data, that's pretty much what you find, because you find that, you know, there's a slightly lower iq. That's now been replicated in the big matter analysis, by the way. At our paper, our finding replicated. There's a huge study came out showed it replicated, which was good. There there's indications that lefthandedness is associated with elevated, fluctuating asymmetry, but it's associated with all sorts of mental problems.
