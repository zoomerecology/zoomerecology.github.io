Why did humans have all fondness for music? 

Nobody really knows where music came from. Uh, one, one possibility is it's a form of emotional based communication. So music can invoke emotional states in people, and so therefore, being able to generate music might be a way of sort of exerting emotional control over other people, or being able to communicate with them in, uh, sort of more profoundly emotional ways. Um, it it also signals creativity and intelligence. This is Jeffrey Miller's theory. It's been selected as part of our sort of fitness repertoire, our shortterm mating orientation. Why birds sing songs?

So it's a way of, sort of, very rapidly being able to appraise the quality of an individual using a multivariate index of genetic quality that taps lots of different dimensions simultaneously, like memory and timing ability and general intelligence and, you know, reaction time and, and all these different sort of dimensions, essentially, maybe personal personality traits are present in musical productions.

I'm sure they are. Well, you can get into flow. There's a term they use in music. It's called flow, isn't it? Yes, that's right. Flow is a real thing. This is something that our friend, guy, has studied quite extensively.
