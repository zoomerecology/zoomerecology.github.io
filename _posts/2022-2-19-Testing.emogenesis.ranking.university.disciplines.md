I think I might have devised a very novel prediction that the group selected model of genius would lead us to expect is true. And that is that the certain traits should, in fact, be emogetic. So what that means is that instead of the alleles for these traits having a linear dose effects on the trait of interest, the addition of each new allele should actually increase the level of the trait in a nonlinear fashion, so an exponential factor. In other words, identical twins should be much, much more identical to one another than nonidentical twins. In the case of emogetic traits, where they're coming together and having these nonlinear effects on the trait, then regular identical twins in the case of normal additivity, where it's summative. Essentially, each new genetic variant adds to the trait in a sort of linear or dosedependent fashion. So my idea is very simple, and this, I don't think, is something that has actually been done. 

And that is to basically look at the effect of iq plus traits which are not genetically correlated with Iq, which is what we'd expect from group selection. Because, don't forget in group selection, you're trying to keep these traits sort of apart from one another because you want, you want them only very rarely to combine in single individuals, because such individuals are very costly and only really benefit the group. So you want to sort of keep their numbers quite low. So it makes sense to have all the raw ingredients for genius noncorrelated of each other genetically. So therefore the likelihood of getting these genetic correlations is purely a function of the size of a group, essentially, the pool of the raw materials that can combine into genius.

And the idea would be to see if the, if you can take traits which are uncorrelated, so, say, iq and life history speed, and use them to predict, to use them to actually predict the levels of things like creative achievement in a way that would be consistent thermogenesis. It doesn't does having high K and high g combining produce exponentially more creative achievement than just having high g or high k alone. And if we look at the behavior genetics of these traits. So in theory, if we had a data set where we had, say, G, K for life history, creative achievement test, and we have these things for twins as well, could we actually model this directly as an emogenesis effect by showing that when you combine twins who have very high levels of both, you get this multiplicative, rather than this additive effect on heritability of the trait in the identical twins versus the nonidentical.

So it's a very, very simple idea. We can do this for a whole bunch of traits. In theory, we can build a kind of group selected trait covariance matrix among these different independent sources of individual differences. It's an idea that would be really simple to do. In general, genius and whatever, it's about additive genes that don't come together very often. And that's why, very normal parents have these mega children who are geniuses. But then if they don't breed true in the children. Exactly, got it right? But then these are genes which are not nonadditive, but they're very unlikely to combine, but if you can make them combine, then it's just, boom, it's just an explosion of brilliance that presumably exactly.

So the idea is having having high Iq is great. It makes you very creative. Maybe having high K makes you very creative as well. We don't know. We haven't actually looked at those patterns of association. But what about when you have both high g and high K in one individual, compared to people who are just high energy or just high impact? Does having both give you a multiplicative advantage? In other words, does it make you exponentially more?

So it's having a high intelligence good for you in life, having high K, high general factor of personality, agreeableness, conscientious, extroversion, whatever good for you in life. Both together, do they set off a feedback loop of brilliance? Particularly brilliantly. 

But then the weird thing about it though, is, when we talk about genius, though, we normally talk about very, very high g and moderately low K. So if you put it back to genius, then could you there's an optimum there, presumably, that sets off a is that, is that an idea that could be looked at an optimum level of it, optimum level K? Well, this could be interesting. And your prediction would be that it would not necessarily be a linear effective K. It would be a nonlinear effect of K. So in other words, it might be having, not so much having an optimum level relative to g, for example, which might best be captured by a nonlinear function. So that is a good possibility, and that's actually something that we can look into by modeling that dose dependence, that interaction between the two, essentially using a a quadratic term, as opposed to, say, a linear term, or having a quadratic term estimated net of a linear term, which would give us a really good idea if there's a genuinely nonlinear effect on the trait of interest.

And how does this help in terms of, one of the criticisms that some people have leveled against our research is this idea, well, you're not thinking about the fact that we could save civilization with social engineering and that kind of thing. We could just my kind of counter argument to that is that you don't seem to understand that things like people like geniuses come up, as collateral relatives of people that are mental. So if you, if you say, okay, this is a bad trait, people being mental. Let people having schizophrenia, let's say, or autism, let's get rid of it, then the consequence of that is that you're indirectly getting rid of genius. 

I think there's a certain validity to that. Um, because there's an old saying, genius and madness are sort of, uh, only separated from one another by a very thin line. There's the work of Dean Keith simmons as well, who has actually shown that you can kind of rank disciplines based on hardness versus softness. And it turns out there's one underlying dimension that corresponds to how hard a discipline is versus how soft it is. And this relates to things like graph prominence. And it relates to things like the degree to which the there's a lot of sort of mathematical condensation in the text versus a lot of verbal waffle. Sympathetic circularities of the use of ums and uhs, also known as lecture disfluency. The idea of concepts lack concreteness. Subjects which are softer, like in say, social psychology, they tend to have multiple different sort of operationalizations of the same construct and nobody really agrees on the meaning of anything. There's constant semantic debates. Whereas in mathematics and physics and chemistry, there's a biology, there's very concrete definitions of things. Things have very specific meanings, essentially. Like a ribosome is a ribosome. There's no ambiguity about that. Or a quark is a quark, you know, there's no ambiguity about but the class of particles known as quarks everyone agrees there's a family of particles known as quarks. So there's no negotiational component to that.

And you can rank these disciplines. And it's interesting, because one of the things simmonson speculated in a paper he published in either 2008 or 2009, he came out in perspectives and psychological science, uh, one thing he speculated is that when you get down to the very softest of the soft essentially. And by the way, psychology is kind of a midline in this division. So psychology has a hard and a soft, and it sort of straddles the midline. And when you go into sort of freudianism and things like that, psychoanalysis, that would be very soft, very impressionistic, versus, say, behavior genetics, which would be very hard and scientific Ultimately, all of these disciplines can be ranked, so everything's going to have a, you know, unilinear ranking. But he argued, when you get down to the very bottom, the softest of the soft essentially, it's possible that you're getting into poetry. He argued that poetry might be at the very bottom of this continuum, and that when you go below that, you get madness. So it's possible that poets are about as close to being truly mad as it's possible to get.

Within science, the people who are often these genius types within science, are in some ways more more poetic, more intuitive in their in their approach. Yes, that's right. Than the incrementalists.
