When the industrial revolution hits in, that's when dysgenics is going to start. And so the industrial revolution has hit in different races, and indeed in different ethnic groups, indeed in different classes, in the sense of disgenetics, more or less recently. 

And so consequently, it's hitting first with english people. So we would expect english people to be the most dysgenic, which is obvious if you walk around a high street in Bolton. And that's why I think one of the reasons why finns have higher iq in other european countries is because the industrial revolution hit in there later.

I have actually got data on the times at which each country has gone into the fertility transition. So this is sort of the year in which the fertility went from a positive growth to a sort of negative growth type type dynamic. So for example, in Europe, it's mostly in the 1800s. And in other parts of the world, it's slightly later. And in some places it's, you know, very recent, like Africa, fertility's really just started to sort of level off there in in very recent years in some countries, and it's not showing any signs of leveling off in others.

But what you can do is you can correlate that those years in which the fertility transition occurred with the actual strength of the negative association between Iq and fertility, or rather, the association between educational attainment and fertility. Because we don't have a huge crossnational data set on national Iq and fertility. We have a very good crossnational data set, thanks to the world values survey, on educational attainment and fertility. We have that for about 40 countries. And I have found a correlation between the two that is quite high. I'm not going to give it away. I'm not going to say what it is. But the correlation is in a direction suggested of the idea that the more recent the demographic transition, the stronger the negative association between educational attainment and fertility. 

So this means the countries that went through the demographic transition a long, long time ago have weaker correlations between educational attainment and fertility, more weakly negative associations between those two things, than in the case of countries which are, still, you know, which went through the demographic transition much more recently, or are still yet to go through the demographic transition.

So you could divide these along racial lines as well if you wanted to. So if you wanted to, you can. I can do this. I can, I can. I can group based on continents. You could have Asia, Africa, and Europe. I think, of the three major continental clusters that arise. And you'll probably find, yes, among europeans, the strength of this negative association will actually be weaker than in the case of east asians and in the case of africans. And I can pass the data out that way.
