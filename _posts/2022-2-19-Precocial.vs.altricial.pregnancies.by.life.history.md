Any theory or evidence that pregnancies and infants of our strategists are healthier as they're more likely to have evolved under greater stress, I don't know why that would make them healthier.

Well, the interesting thing is that virtually all of the indicators of prematurity and things like this. People who have difficulty being born, people who are more likely to be premature, they're probably come from faster like history parents than people who were born on schedule. Early births certainly are more likely to be common among individuals with faster life histories. 

There is another dimension associated with life history that's probably worth thinking about, and that is the precocial versus ultra cool index. So precocity is basically when or precociousness is when you're born like a miniature adult, right? So you're, you're born with a lot of faculties intact, and a lot of sort of hardwired ability to just go and do stuff, and minimum learning is required. And essentially the juveniles resemble miniature adults. 

Whereas, the ultratickle dimension is associated with the idea of being born, in a sort of vulnerable state where you require lots of care and investment. So one possibility is that very healthy, faster life history, offspring mature much more quickly, and this means that they could start walking earlier in life. But I think Phil Rushton argued at the racial level. So I suspect it's true at the individual differences level. It's just nobody's done the experiment, nobody's done the, you know, research, experimental work yet. I think that you probably find that access will also associate with life history. So the fast end might be associated with higher risk of things going wrong, like prematurity, you know, genetic diseases of infancy and childhood, childhood cancers, all that stuff. Risk is going to be elevated in people with past life histories.

Why is the risk of childhood cancer going to be elevated in them in faster history influence? Because basically, uh, people with slow life histories will invest more somatic effort into, uh, dna repair. So they will ensure that their somatic mutation rate is suppressed. So every, every aspect of their physiology that's influenced by the accumulation of mutations will be attenuated in people with slow life history. So they will be, need optimists for longer age, right? 

So rather than, rather than just invest the energy and dna repair, you invest in finding mates and having sex with them. I see. Yes, that's right. But that's the risk dimension. But at the same time, the individuals like, they're  they're going to mature much more quickly. They might have higher learning potential earlier on in life as well. Um, they might be better at solving certain kinds of cognitive problems than their slow, life history counterparts, until the slow, likely counterparts kind of overtake. So, yeah, there's a variety of different things going on among people.
