Why are higher Iq people night owls? Do they require less sleep? Or are they simply, do they simply go to bed later? 

Well, the theory is that we are adapted on the savannah to be the opposite of that. And so as we move away from it, then we we get selected for evolutionarily, novel things. And this includes being a night owl. Is there any any better theory than that? 

I know that Satoshi's theory, I know David Piffer has also worked on this question, and he's replicated a lot of his stuff. What piffer has done is he's, he's argued that there might be, and I hope I'm not mischaracterizing his argument, but he suggests there might be genetic overlaps between the circadian system and intelligence. So it might be that some of the genes which control, the circadian rhythm in humans, sort of photoperiodic genes, which allow us to detect day length and things like that might be related to Iq in some interesting and novel way, and also to personality. Because it turns out that K strategy, people who are more k elected and have low time preferences,  they tend to be diurnal. They tend to be morning larks. Because people who have fast life history tend to be night owls. So it turns out that the ultimate combination to have if you want to be a night owl is to be a high iq, r strategist
