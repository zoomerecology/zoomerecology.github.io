The optimum group strategy is ethnocentrism.

The optimum political strategy is political ethnocentrism.

The optimum economic strategy is intolerance for competition against ethnocentricity,

The optimum legal strategy is rule of law (reciprocity) that enforces non defection against ethnocentrism by a **prohibition on internalization of costs and externalization of returns.(Socialization of costs, and privatization of commons).**
