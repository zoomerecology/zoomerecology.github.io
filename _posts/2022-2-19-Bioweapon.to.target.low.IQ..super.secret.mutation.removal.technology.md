Could a virus that somehow lowers the virility of those with low Iq peacefully substitute for a harsh ecology that selects for iq? Um, well, presumably. I mean, it wasn't so much in preindustrial revolution, it wasn't so much that Iq was being selected for, when Iq was being selected for. But there was massive child mortality of 40% and that was disproportionately among those who were low socioeconomic status, and thus those of low iq. That was what was happening. So in a sense, there were lots of viruses, and they were selecting against the virility of those with low iq. That's literally what was happening. Is that a fair enough point? 

Yes. And i'd also say that I believe that was the plot, more or less, of a famous science fiction book, the name of which escapes me, right? 

I thought you were going to expand there, but no. So, yeah. So, that's actually what was going on. That was what was happening. That's how we got where we are. There were numerous viruses, and those viruses killed off people with low iq. They did so because people with low Iq were less able to create environments that were conducive to fighting off those viruses. And perhaps also those people with low, like low iq. But it could it be that they just had more mutational load, and that was reflected in lower IQ?

People of low iq are multivariately vulnerable to sources of extrinsic mortality. So in other words, they're likely to be on the receiving end of pretty much any nasty, unpredictable thing that the environment has. There's going to be comorbidities with higher mutation load as well. We know that some of the variation in Iq is a function of rare variance in the genome. So yes, people with low Iq probably have slightly elevated mutation loads, based on the data that we have. So yes, like I say, multivariate vulnerability, lots and lots of different ways in which they're generally vulnerable. This would be a fundamental problem, though, if we return to an earlier question we were asked with regard to eugenics and so on. Because even if we were selecting in favor of clever and clever people, and we were somehow following galston's idea about creating a kind of a religion, or whatever it was, or or Patel's idea. Making society continue to be more intelligent, wouldn't be doing anything about mutational load. So it would be becoming sicker. It would be becoming more intelligent and sicker. So sick that things began to collapse anyway as well.

Yes, be an easier, it might be an easier problem to solve than we think. How would you do that? I'm not going to say.

Because, it's naughty. No, not at all, actually. Because it's, it relates to some intellectual property that I'm working on at the moment, which could very easily reduce, could very easily reduce mutation load in the genome. But I'm not going to say how, because it's based, yeah, my nature of intellectual property. Well, yes, we've worked out a way to save humanity. This is good news. You heard it here first.
