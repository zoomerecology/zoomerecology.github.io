Is it better to try and accelerate the inevitable collapse of society so that we won't decline too far genetically? 

Interesting. Accelerationist. The idea is that if we, if if we decline at the rate we're declining, this is something that Bruce Charlton has talked about as well, that we've become so just revoltingly dysgenic and our genes so messed up, the the next time around in the cycle, we won't be able to rise anywhere near as high again, because our genes will just be so messed up. 

I don't know about that, because I think that really there are these two factors. One is the, you know, one is the presence and rapidity of selection. The other is the efficiency of purifying selection. So if you had a regime in which you've had very high levels of extrinsic mortalitity, in which you've got a lot of variance in mortality, which usually always yields a, you know, a condition convivial to purifying selection, in addition to fast life history traits as well, and you have a sufficient sort of penalty for being unable to cope with, uh, evolutionarily novel problems. Problems which have domain general rather than problems which are just domain specific, then over enough period, over a long enough period of time, integrated across enough bounce of reproduction, you should be able to essentially restore, uh, restore populations to their factory settings in terms of levels of mutation load, levels of G etc.

Okay, so but the question, you see, the argument I have with bruce is Bruce tends to think about these things as if they were so there were these directional cycles, right? And that that goes up and down, and each time selection is pulling towards the same optimum. And there might be endogenous factors that kind of prevent you from getting back to that optimum if things have gotten so bad, uh, in in the collapse phase of the previous cycle. I'd argue that, no, there's no sort of privilege direction to selection, not what we know of. It could well be that in the next cycle we get selected for something other than intelligence. So in that case, it doesn't really matter if we have smaller brains or less efficient central nervous systems. If if the advantage is to something else, then selection will favor that. So what you have to hope is that with each each new sort of population cycle, that the primary thing that is being selected for is intelligence. If it's not, then it doesn't really matter. Intelligence is out of the equation. It's going to be whatever is salient to selection of that point in time that's really going to become the focal point of selection.
