Do you having to add on different times of the year requiring different emotional responses?

I would say cold weather in general, under evolution, requires you to be more conscientious, to develop groups, more agreeableness, less mentally unstable, less extrovert, less testing new things more dangerous in that sense. So it selects in favor of a different kind of emotional response to it being hot all the time, basically. 

Well, I think that it does make sense that there should be mood adaptations, essentially. But there seems to be some variety in terms of how people actually adapt to different moods. Which is best manifest best illustrated, actually, in the heightened contrasts that you get with two different kinds of effective disorders. One is sort of seasonal effective disorder, type one, I think it's called, which is the traditional one, where people become miserable in the winter and very happy during the summer months. And that's sort of pretty much my situation. I hate the winter. I hate cold. I love it when it's sun and lovely weather and you can go out and walk it's warm and nice. And other people have the opposite.

There's a type two one, which is which is basically, this is why I spent half my time in tucson, of course. But there's another one, which is, which is a type two. And the type 2 seems to be the seems to be the opposite is when people don't they love it when it's cold and miserable and pissing with rain and gray and overcast and vile and disgusting and horrible and muddy. But when it's nice and warm and sunny and beautiful, and you just want to be alive. They want to crawl into a hole and die.

Actually. I hate light. I hate light. I hate light. I like rain. At least at least one of the coauthors on this book, I won't mention it loves it when it's pissing with rain and miserable. I'm not going to name it.

I'd get on with that person. We should, me and him should meet.

So would it be related? Life history strategy? I don't know if it's associated with life history strategy, or it might be that, actually, it's more adaptive strategy, even more sort of slow life history strategy is to reduce your energy output during the winter and to become more sort of, and that's the thing, and not waste, not waste time and effort running around, you know, trying to, trying to sort of optimize your fitness, if you know what I mean. Whereas in the summer, that's the time to do it, you see, because it makes sense. So, so it could be, if you're oriented the other way, then then you're burning up all your energy maladaptively in the winter by being active somewhere when you're supposed to be active, you're not. You're frawn and sullen because for some reason you don't like sunshine.
