How great was the genetic contribution of various invasions, Eg Romans, vikings, and what effects would these uh have likely had on British character?

Again, it's a really good question, because what you have is we know, from looking at the history of uh, of the movements of genes in in historical populations, that you had, for example, large numbers, large an infusion of haplogroup i, the sort of viking scandinavian groups into the uh, particularly the East Coast of England, where they, they sort of had this dominance for many, many years in East Anglia, very high prevalence, or penetrance, of Hackler group I. And the the interesting uh thing about it is that, and we have a paper which we're working on, which i'll give you a sort of sneak preview on, is we're using the degree to which different counties in England are tilt towards being haplogroup r, that's for sort of celtic haplogroup, or haplogroup Group I, that's the viking haplogroup. And what we found is that the ratio of the two can be used to predict the outcome of the civil war, the english civil war, so it turns out the english civil war was essentially perpetrated by vikings by danes, or people with danish ancestry, who had sort of danish, you know, Jante culture type egalitarian views, who rejected sort of, celtic, catholic, aristocratic type systems of government, and who wanted parliamentary democracy instead of rule by aristocracy. And it was an ethnic war. This english civil war, we have found, was an ethnic war. And what you find is that where you have the sort of concentration of haplogroup i versus haplogroup r, you can see the spread of the of the war into those areas where the ratio is a certain way, it guarantees defeat or guarantees victory, depending on the direction of a ratio. And at the end of the day, what what the civil war looked like, in terms of sort of the biogeography was, as a biogeographical event, was you have this joining up of all these pockets of haplogroup I across England, which kind of ring from us. 

So you're saying the catholic side in the war was the celtic side, right? Yes, that's exactly right. And the North of England, cheshire and lancashire and whatever, they were highly recusant. And they were, they, they were catholic, yes. Also, the viking weren't they in the north of England? 

Uh, no, not not really. The biggest degree of viking influx is is on the East coast. And that's true of scotland as well. 

But you have all these places in Northern England that have vic on the end and Ham. 

Well, there might be concentrations of haplogroup either, but, uh, but the biggest concentrations are in East Anglia. And of course, that is where Ollie Cromwell came from. It. Well, yes, Huntington's tree, yeah, yeah, cambridge. That's right. So, it's all right.

So that could, could that be applied to the wall of the roses as well? 

It could, yes. And what's more is, is it could also be applied to, uh, to America. Oh, really. So the american civil war, we think, was similar. We think, we think the coastal elites in America, sort of wasp elites who descend from these, uh, you know, these pilgrims, the mayflower, Plymouth rock, this whole sort of group was a high heckler group, eye kind of leveller phenotype, uh, which moved over to America and settled the coasts. And then you have these celts, essentially, who settled the south. And what you had essentially was, it was a, was endemic negation of irreducibly pluralistic economies, because the south was, in a lot of ways more aristocratic, wasn't it it? Had they essentially developed the kind of plant and nobility and and they saw it in that way. Yes, that is consistent with your argument. Yes, that's right. We need to test it, of course. But in England, we know that the the, uh, the strongholds, the areas we had the highest levels of parliamentarians, uh, were definitely ones which had more sort of, uh, scandinavian ancestry, and it was the celtic ancestry. Well, stereotypes about the conformity of this, of the scandinavians there, wouldn't it? Yes. But with that about about under the sort of the small gene pool, and sort of democratic in that in a broad sense.
