Effects of horse domestication on group selection?

Oh, huge. Absolutely massive. One of our projects is actually looking at the history of horse domestication as a major vector for increasing the efficiency of groups in intergroup competition. Yes, it does seem that if you look at where horses were domesticated, and you look at the specific breeds that were domesticated, the very successful breeds seem to be associated with groups that actually weaponize them and use them in intergroup conflict. So like any weapon, essentially, anything that increases the efficiency of a group relative to another group is going to lead to the first group being able to successfully out compete the latter group, and in so doing, boost its corporate fitness. So, yeah, horses would fall under that category. So, absolutely massive impact. We we're collecting data on this, and, yeah, we've seen there is, there is a pattern to the to the domestication
