Does preference for cartoon? He's obviously referring to his japanese cartoon, right? Has a certain personality over lesbianism in Russia. So he's obviously arguing about the pornhub data. So a lot of data collected by pornhub and other groups which were interested in trying to work out crossnational differences in preferences to these sort of things. So he's saying that, apparently in Russia, there is a preference for lesbianism over japanese cartoon. Um, he says, cartoon being about cuteness, as opposed to hotness, show greater K in Russia than America?

So he's saying, does this preference in Russia, uh, show signs that they are more case selected in Russia than America? So does does having a preference for, um, hotness? No, sorry. Cuteness make you more k strategy. It make you more of a k strategist than a preference for hotness.

Okay, so he's saying there's a dimension here of cuteness versus hotness. He's saying, he says, gives lesbianism as an example. I don't know, he's not **operationalized** it in any quantitative way. But that's what he's saying. That is the question.

So cuteness would be like child likeness, and hotness would be what big secondary sexual characteristics? I have no idea. It's very difficult to interpret it. This is a tradeoff between, yeah, I would think that would be that. Certainly on a racial level, that would be the case. You would say that people who were North East Asian were cute. I mean that they are childlike in that sense, they are cute, but they are, they are neotimists. And people that are black or bushmen or whatever have large secondary sexual characteristics. I assume that's what you mean by heart. So there would be a tradeoff. That would make sense. And you would expect the Japanese for more k strategy, to be less interested in in secondary sexual characteristics, because they are shortterm things that advertise genetic quality quickly, and to be more interested in cuteness. Uh, because this is associated with, a slow life history strategy. the optimus traits seem to be associated, in the racial level, at the individual level as well, with a slow life history strategy.

My theory of lesbianism, you told me that it sexually arouses men because it means that the the the they won't get cuckholded, because they'll just bang each other. That's right. That's a fidelity signal. And I was writing it down, that you're here, right? It was my theory. I was writing it up, and then I was completely scooped. There was a paper published that did make the claim. 

Which paper was that? I think diane fleischman might actually be on the authorship list, or at the very least she commented on it in the media.
