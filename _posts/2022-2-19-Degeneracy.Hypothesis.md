The degeneracy hypothesis of maladaptive pleasureseeking behavior becoming more normative post60s crime, associated with rising drug use, sexual promiscuity, etc.

The proofs have a degeneracy hypothesis is real. There is a there are real negative shifts on multiple different axes of things like declining iq, increasing criminality since the 60s. Now you have uh, all sorts of things, but there's 34 different sort of negative trends, essentially, going on simultaneously. And we even conduct an analysis of these, which I presented in one of my technical heretic videos. Where we use this theory, which we've been talking about, social epistasis model. This all relates to the sort of disruptive effects of mutations that have accumulated, that have a specific, very negative effect on the fitness of noncarriers through the ability for the mutants to sort of steer culture in these maladaptive or nongroup selected ways. I mean, this might have sort of released from latency a lot of these antisocial tendencies and what he's referring to here as degenerating tendencies.

So, and Degeneracy, in this instance, I take to mean moving away from group selection towards individual level selection. What was it about the 60s, though, the collapse of religiousness? I mean, that's the yes, I think that was a big part of it. In the 60s.

Even Stephen Pinker, I remember, I remember when I was an undergraduate, he came to our university to give a talk about the second edition of his, uh, the blank, the blank slate book. And he put up a figure, and he was talking about, you know, how everything's getting wonderful, and how everything is great, and everything is perfect, except except here. In the 60s, we apparently had this reversal of the longterm decline in in criminality. And he actually noticed this, and I think he might have been the first person to notice that, the reversal of the 60s. But there was a, there was a reversal in the 60s in in homicide rates, um, things did get a little bit more violent for a little while, which was quite interesting.

And the reason for this, might have been because really the 60s was a phased transition. So it was this rapid shift between two cultural norms. Um you had this sort of more refined, more group selected, more, uh, marshall, more high binding in the sort of height sense of the term, high authority, high purity, high loyalty, high religiosity, sort of culture, which characterized the sort of bucolic 1950s. And then you end the 40s, of course.

And then you have this massive shift towards this sort of hips, hipster hippie culture, all that too as well, but hippie culture, with its lagrange violation of norms, it's, it's sort of, uh, embracing of alternative, uh, you know, social and sexual expressions, etc. And the net effect of this would have been to really, really strongly perturb these group selected cultural facets, which were responsible for guiding development, essentially, and to cause them to break down, which would have released, in developmental time. It would have released all of these maladaptive phenotypes, which would have contributed to this very quick breakdown in group selection.

We have some data on this. And I thought I did put this out in a video, but just very, very briefly, there's a couple of data points on this. One is, prior to the 1960s, the heritability of age at sexual debut was virtually zero, right the age at which you had your first intercourse. After the 1960s, the heritability rose. And it's interesting, because we see a similar thing with the paternal age effect on religiosity. Prior to the 1960s, after you control for everything, including parental religiosity, offspring church attendance is not correlated with paternal age. And paternal age, by the way, is a proxy for De Novo mutations. All the fathers pass on more new mutations or else being equal to their offspring. So you can use paternal age as a measure of how the degree to which a trait is under mutation selection balance. However, after the 1960s, there is a nontrivial, eternal age effect on church attendance, such that the offspring of all the fathers attend church less frequently.

So both of these findings suggest that the 60s involved a breakdown of cultural controls on behavior, which would have reduced the heritability or reduced the expressivity of mutations in populations when those controls were very strong, when those norms were guiding behavior, and then there were strong social pressures forcing people, even if they had mutations or they had a heritable disposition towards the early age of sexual debut, opportunities to express their atheism or promiscuity or what have you, were not present. They were strongly controlled.

So it literally proves that religion played that that vital role in maintaining civilization. That's absolutely fascinating.
