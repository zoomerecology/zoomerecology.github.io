he question is, I think, do they have a higher load of mutations there? 

This is very controversial, because there's a big literature on this in genetics, about which races have higher loads of mutations. And it turns out to be looking at synonymous versus nonsynonymous load. And if you look at synonymous load, it turns out that, that actually europeans have higher rates of mutations. If you're looking at other forms of load, it might be that it's more equally distributed between racial groups. But there's a reason we would expect europeans in particular to have higher loads of mutations, and that's because they've been subjected to, they've been subjected to more vigorously relaxed purifying selection. As on this consequence, their genomes should be higher in mutation load. Mutation load or mutation accumulation theory.
