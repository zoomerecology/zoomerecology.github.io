Do parents invest less in gay children? 

I guess it would, could potentially make sense once they discovered a child was gay and was not going to pass on their genes. I think that in the case of the samoan faffin. So these are these these kids were basically raised as androphiles in this third gender role. This is a group that Paul Vasey has studied extensively. He's argued that they actually invest more effort into these fafafine as they're called. Because the payoff, there are fitness payoffs to having them around through high evocularity. And he's found that they have more nieces and nephews, so it's sort of consistent with eo. Wilson's theory of the gay uncle theory, as it's called. It just doesn't seem to work unless you have a very high relative, level of relatedness, like high inbreeding among the population in order to boost the fitness payoffs to having avuncular sort of uncles and things running around, helping with the rearing of children. 

Okay, so no. The answer then, from what we can work out, is for one group, yes, everywhere else no.
