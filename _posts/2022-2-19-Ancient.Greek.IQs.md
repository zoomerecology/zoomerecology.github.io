Has you been able to come up with an estimated average iq for Greeks, athenians of the fifth century bc?

The answer that is no. And do you have any kind of ballpark estimate? Well, Galton said that the Athenians were, I think, I think he said they were a grade above the victorian average. And a grade, I think, was a standard deviation. So based on his estimation, assuming the Victorians had an iq of, say, 110, that would give them an iq of 125 by modern sort of 100 standards. So we're going based on the idea G has declined. So g was 110 in the victorian era, G is 100 today. And the difference would be scaled relative to the sort of predis journey losses, essentially, right?

And when we say the athenians, he's talking sort of 400 bc. Socrates, around that kind of time, is he? 

That's right. Yes. So presumably, from what we were discussing last week, on the week before, it would have been even higher among the the mycenaeans. 

I don't know about that. I don't have any data. All we have in our data set of ancient genomes is minoan and mycenaean genomes. Uh, we don't have any athenians? We'd like to have athenians. And we'd like to have these sort of hellenic and classical era greeks, because they may have been even smarter than the mycenaeans. But all we know is that the myceneans were the smartest of the bunch, and they outranked the minoans, the neolithic Greek civilizations that preceded the Minoan settlement, and the modern Greeks, of which we have a small number, four genomes, but they're more or less representative of Greece. 

If it was as high as that, that's quite extraordinary, isn't it? That's based on Galton's estimate? Yes, yeah. And his sds are the same as rsds. It's the same. There's a little bit of impressionism. Um, one I think Anatoly Carlin stated that a grade might have been closer to 10.5 Iq points than a whole standard deviation, so maybe 120 or 121 versus, okay, yeah. So there's still, we're still, we're still in the realms of sort of ashkenazi Linguistic Iq, but iq. Yeah, it's still pretty extraordinary.

Okay so you'll be correct in thinking that their iq would have been considerably higher than ours. If that estimate would be a fair few assumptions is correct.
