polyamory is is multiple men with one woman. It doesn't seem to create stable societies. It seems to be patriarchy that does that.

Polyamory is something that I know a lot of people are pushing at the moment, like Jeffrey Miller for example. Polyamory is utterly inimical to civilization. It can not, it is not a basis on which you can have the sort of trust dynamics necessary to maintain the functioning of a civilization. I know people are trying to normalize it, but those people are, in my opinion they're edge cases, shall we say, um, clever sillies is the term, but I think Bruce Charlton would use to describe them. 

hy is it an inimical civilization? Because basically, under a polyamorous situation, you have these resource you have, uh, a situation in which a very small number of males can dominate the mating market, which means intermale trust can not arise. 

Well, polyamory is actually a very good there's polygyny, polyandry, which is what you mentioned earlier. It's very rare. Polygyny is quite common, uh, particularly in places like Africa and the Middle East, tends to go hand in hand with consanguinity. Polyamory is this sort of very peculiarly modern thing, uh, which is based on the idea that, someone's just described it as hypercuckery. I think that's a really, really good description. But the idea is you just have no attachments, no bonds. There's fluid sexual relationships.

You can't have that. Civilization is based around people being able to trust each other and cooperate, particularly based on positive and negative ethnocentrism. We have numerous computer models that have shown this again and again and again. You can't create positive ethnocentrism without trust. You can only have trust between men if men are in conflict. And it's men that's facing the innovate civilization and whatever. If men aren't in conflict over girls, how can men not be in conflict over girls? Either you have monogamy, or you have patriarchy in the context of of polygamy, or something like that. But there has to be something to reduce male paternity anxiety and to reduce into male conflict. Polyamory is evidently a recipe for male conflict. So you're going to get fighting and violence and whatever. So it's a stupid idea, and anyone that advocates it's a spiteful mutant wants to destroy civilization. And if Jeffrey Miller is advocating it, I had quite a lot of respect for him until now. Then, well that tells me he is probably weighs the same as a duck. Okay?
