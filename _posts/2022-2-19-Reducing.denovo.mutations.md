I looked more into your advice and have been refrigerating my balls. My family were repulsed, but I told them I was just trying to have normal children, much like myself.

On a serious note, should men be encouraged to freeze their sperm in their teens for their future wives to slow the rate of in order to slow the rate of mutation low? One thing I think that men should probably, if they're not planning on having kids until their 40s, they should probably freeze, or better, hedge their bets and donate to a sperm bank or something like that, if they intend to have children.
