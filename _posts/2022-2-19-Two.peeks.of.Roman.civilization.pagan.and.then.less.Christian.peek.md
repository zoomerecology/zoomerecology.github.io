You see a peak of innovation in Rome, and then it goes down again. And then there's another peak, which doesn't reach as high as the first peak. And then it goes down again, even further. Yeah. So this is, this is completely consistent with the idea that the, in the time of Christ, basically, Rome was in decline. There was a revival under christianity, which peaked in, I don't know, 200. And then by the three hundreds, it had 350, it had, it was collapsing down. So, there was two cycles of roman civilization in that, in that sense, before it goes right down into the dark ages.
