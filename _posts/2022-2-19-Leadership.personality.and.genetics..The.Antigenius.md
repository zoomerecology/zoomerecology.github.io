What can you tell me about leadership? 

I quite like Max Weber's model of charisma. The idea that a leader has a special kind of personality which can make the world, see, a cold world, seem warm again. And, if we look at some studies that have been done on the kind of people that become leaders, there's some evidence that they are , I mean, great leaders, I don't mean like leaders of your local church choir, that they have sort of certain particular personality traits, basically autism, sort of autistic sort of traits. Moderately low agreeableness, moderately low conscientiousness. Moderately high mental instability. So that's psychopathic traits in some ways. And then mental instability associated with quite high intelligence. And this seems to be the personality trait of great leaders.

I had two interesting things about leadership. David Licken developed the model of emogensis, one of the traits that he thought was going to be heavily nonadditive in terms of the sort of way in which the genes combined to give rise to it was leadership, particularly extraordinary leadership. And what he, what, I think, he found, when he looked at some twin data on sort of twins who attained leadership roles, this sort of thing, he found, I think, there was much higher monozygotic similarity than dizygotic similarity, much higher than one would expect based on the idea that dizygotic twins, or fraternal twins, have 50 percent of their genome in common. So instead of having, say, you know, 0.25 correlation versus, say, a 0.1 correlation, let's say a 0.1 correlation with the end, with the dizygotic twins, and a 0.8 correlation between the monozygotic twins, that suggests that having, um, some genes is good, having more genes is exponentially better.

So leadership might be one of these very rare traits which comes about largely as a result of rare gene combinations. It's a bit like genius. The other thing that's interesting about leadership is that one of, it's one of the few areas where I believe that game theorists have actually made a sort of fairly substantive contribution to our understanding of human behavior. And they have come up with a fairly good model of leadership, which is based on a very straightforward principle, that is based on the idea that a leader is anyone who basically takes the **first mover advantage**. So this is the first mover in any kind of game, someone who moves to break an equilibrium. For example, a person who initiates the breaking of the equilibrium, or initiates a maneuver in a game, often is someone who has leadership potential or leadership traits. So it seems that you can boil the leadership, much of what leadership is down to, to a sort of first mover advantage that accrues to, you know, to those who take the initiative. 

And this would segue nicely into what you are saying about how leaders tend to have moderately low levels of conscientiousness and moderately low levels of agreeableness. Because to be these sort of risktaking initiativeseeking moving people, they would have to be somewhat defiant of social conventions. They'd have to be somewhat sort of defiant of conventions, of crowds, etc. They'd have to be the sort of people who'd be willing to, you know, to take those kinds of risks and break the rules wherever. Rewards to doing so are potentially very big, but also the costs are very big as well. Think of all the failed leaders out there who made bad moves or took their countries to disastrous wars, etc, etc.

The antileader, or the antigenius, or whatever, would presumably have the same qualities, but in a very, very bad way. 

The antigenius is very interesting, because the the antigenius, you can think of the antigenius as being to individual level selection, what a true genius is to group selection. So whereas a true genius will promote the flourishing group through doing something terribly noble and terribly selfsacrificing. The antigenius will do the exact opposite. They will inject ideas into a discourse that boosts individual level fitness and encourage people to do things that sort of degrade the efficiency of, yes, of cultural formations that regulate group behavior. So they will explicitly promote and make a virtue out of behaviors that suffer those that keep the group level fitness high.

So they'll subvert group select group stuff in favor of individual um or stuff. Or even worse than that, because sometimes what they're, what they're promoting these days, is not even individual selection, isn't it? It's just death. It's just the death of your genetic interests. 

Well, is that not the ultimate expression of a spiteful mutation? It's worse than even individualism. The most individually selected, the most selfish thing to do to have no children at all.
