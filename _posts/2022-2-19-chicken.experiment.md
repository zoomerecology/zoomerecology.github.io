Let's consider an experiment that was performed on chickens by William Muir and his colleagues at Purdue University’s Department of Animal Sciences in the 1990s.

Their goal was to increase the egg-laying productivity of hens. Chickens evolved to live in flocks, but in the modern poultry industry they are often housed in cages with five to nine hens per cage, so the study was focused on maximizing production in this environment. The design was simple: they monitored how many eggs each hen laid, the most productive hens from each cage were used to breed the next generation, and so on for a number of generations. If the trait of egg productivity is heritable, then this method should substantially increase egg productivity over a number of generations.

But that’s not what happened. Instead, the subsequent generations laid fewer eggs and became more aggressive toward each other. The image opposite shows one of the cages after the experiment had been in progress for five generations. The cage originally housed nine hens, but six were murdered and the survivors had plucked each other’s feathers. No wonder they weren’t laying many eggs!

What happened to produce this ghoulish result? The most productive hens in each cage achieved their productivity by bullying the other hens. Bullying behavior is heritable in chickens, so selecting the biggest bullies led to a strain of hyper-aggressive hens within five generations. The energy expended and stress induced by their constant attacks on each other caused all of them to lay fewer eggs, despite the fact that the most productive had been selected to breed, generation after generation.

In an experiment that was performed in parallel with the first, egg productivity was monitored at the level of whole cages. Instead of breeding the most productive hens within each cage, all of the hens from the most productive cages were selected to breed the next generation. The image shows a cage from this experiment after five generations. All nine chickens are alive and fully feathered, and their egg productivity increased 160% during the course of the experiment.

These two experiments provide beautiful examples of within-group and between-group selection as envisioned by Darwin. The first one highlights the advantage that selfish traits have over cooperative traits within single groups. The chickens in the first image, tormenting and killing each other for their own gain, exhibit traits we would certainly call evil. The second experiment highlights the need for selection at the level of groups to evolve the traits that enable everyone within the group to thrive. The chickens in the second image, living amicably with each other, exhibit behaviors we would certainly call good.
