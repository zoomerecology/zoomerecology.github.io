Let's consider three imaginary people, Tom, Dick, and Harry, who have different psychological motives. Tom is a relative fitness maximizer. If the common-pool resource is a fishery, he wants more fish than others in his group, regardless of the number of fish. Dick is an absolute individual fitness maximizer. He wants as many fish as possible for himself, without caring whether others have more or less than he does. Harry is a group fitness maximizer. He wants to maximize the fish harvest for the group, regardless of his proportion of the catch. In conventional terms, Tom and Dick are variants of egoism and Harry is an altruist. How would they regard the eight design principles?

For Tom, most of the design principles would be rules made to be broken. He cares nothing about the purpose of long-term sustainability (1). Making benefits proportionate to costs (2) thwarts his basic purpose, as do the other principles that are designed to promote fairness within the group (3–6). Tom is an outlaw as far as the design principles are concerned.

Dick would find the design principles acceptable to the degree that a rising tide lifts his boat. He’s fine with long-term sustainability as long as he gets his share. He might even play a role inventing and implementing the design principles if he thought that the alternative would be ruinous to his catch over the long term. But he would also be tempted to subvert the design principles whenever he could increase his absolute catch at the expense of other members of his group. The design principles are needed to keep people like Dick in solid-citizen mode.11

Harry would agree completely with the goal of long-term sustainability (1) and would never be tempted to overexploit the resource for his own gain. Design principles 2–6 wouldn’t be necessary if everyone was like Harry.

Now let’s compare Tom, Dick, and Harry in a different way, as competitors in a Darwinian struggle for existence. Their fitness would depend critically on the presence or absence of the design principles. Tom would thrive in groups that lack the design principles because of all the opportunities to exploit others for his own gain. He would not thrive in groups that possess the design principles. His kind would either go extinct entirely or be maintained at a low frequency in the population.

Dick can potentially fare well in the presence of the design principles, as long as he operates in solid-citizen mode. He will also fare well in their absence, as long as he operates in exploitation mode. If Dick and Tom were stranded together on a single desert island, Tom would probably win because of his obsession with relative fitness, but in a multigroup environment lacking the design principles, Dick would probably beat Tom.12

Harry doesn’t stand a chance in groups that lack the design principles, but how does he fare in competition with Dick in groups that possess the design principles? As long as Dick remains in solid-citizen mode, there is no difference in how they behave and therefore no difference in their fitness. Natural selection would be indifferent as to which type evolves. The fact that Dick is a psychological egoist and Harry is a psychological altruist is irrelevant as far as their evolution is concerned.

Now suppose that Dick, being motivated entirely by self-interest, is occasionally tempted to cheat on the rules imposed by the design principles. This can weigh in his favor if he succeeds or against him if he gets caught. If the design principles are strongly in place, then Dick might become less fit than Harry, who is never tempted to cheat. Harry wins the Darwinian contest—but only if the design principles are strongly in place.

Finally, suppose that we zoom in on Harry and use the latest advances of neurobiology to understand his psychological motives in minute detail. We discover that Harry comes in many varieties. They are all alike at the behavioral level by acting only for the common good, but they differ in their specific motives, like so many ways of skinning the same cat. Unlike the comparison between Dick and Harry, who are behaviorally equivalent under some circumstances but not others, the varieties of Harry are behaviorally equivalent under all circumstances.
