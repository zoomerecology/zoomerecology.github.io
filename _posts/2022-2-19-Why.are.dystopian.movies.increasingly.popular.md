Why is there so much social interest in dystopian themes? It seems there is a collective longing for things to be much worse than they currently are. This impulse seems to accompany social wealth and Largesse. Is it a desire for punishment left over from jewish influence via christianity? I desire for harsher times and struggle? What do you both make of it?

Well, Peter Turchen and others have found evidence that there is, in fact, a tendency for people to be pessimistic when it comes to the attitudes. Are generally pessimistic when things are objectively getting worse. So it seems that this sense that things are getting worse, social pessimism, is based on some kind of collective recognition that things are, in fact getting worse. I mean, humans are equipped with mechanisms or instincts that make them aware of the intrinsic direction of a given civilization or social order. It could even be argued that this is adaptive in some way, in so far as it might prepare individuals for abrupt shifts in the social structure, which might necessitate sort of creation of new social orders, that sort of thing.

So it's almost, in a sense, like dreaming something negative, preparing you for something negative happening.

Well, it's a sort of presentiment, people have a sort of sense of foreboding about the way things are going. And that this, this seems to be present in different points in history with different civilizations which have undergone civilizational declines. So it's the sort of present mood of pessimism, I think, is very definitely a function of underlying genetic shifts occurring within our population. 

It's a very good point, actually. If you think about the decline of ancient Greece, it's when it's in decline that you start to have plays like the flies and these, in a sense it could be argued, these rather dystopian plays about breakdown and collapse. You can actually chart that in ancient literature. So it will be consistent with this. With this height of wealth, comes the perception that the people are no longer believing in the gods, people no longer have the optimism they had when they were, in a sense, more childlike. I think that there was a lady who I caught on twitter who noted earlier, it's also a way of expressing things about the present day. So I think that's probably what, that's what's going on. So we would expect more and more of this pessimistic, dystopian stuff as as we prepare ourselves to deal with actually living in it.
