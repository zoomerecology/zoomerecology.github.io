Could monogamy be a strategy for a group to select for a wider variety of personality types? For useful traits that don't compete sexually, like analytical introverts. So division of labor diversification?

Because under Polygamy, presumably there's a very strong of benefit to being the alpha male, because the the beta males are going to pass on, but proportionately fewer of their genes. So the the the woman is is very much selecting for these alpha males who are high in compatibility, good genes, evidence of good genes, similar under smell to her. So she's a bit compatible, bit of genetic similarity theory and whatever, but mainly for for his status and his and his power. And so obviously it seems to be that you bring in monogamy, you're going to diversify the gene pool, because you're going to be having more of these beta males breeding. But there may, of course, be then commensurate benefits to to doing that, such as a more stable ecology and whatever. But it will aid diversification in that sense, and it will aid more people who can pursue more niches. 

I would recommend reading in line with this division of labor model of personality, the work done by my good colleague, Aj Figueredo, on the coral reef model of personality diversification. So this is that personality variation exists, not just variation in terms of levels of personality traits, but variation in terms of the sort of diversity and personality dimensions exists, because it's a way of dividing labor within a population.

So in other words, if personality could be looked at essentially as the way in which people calibrate their interactions with the environment, and socially so, how they modulate their behavior based on social interactions and things from the environment which have different sort of selective saliences, threats, benefits, that sort of thing, then you have a serious advantage to a highly dense population, to having to maintaining high variability among those dimensions, because that way you can just have this massive payoff in terms of a diversity of ecological strategies and behavioral strategies that can be pursued.

Also, i'd recommend looking at our workout on the strategic differentiation integration effort hypothesis. So this is based on the idea that, in addition to having high sort of variety among these traits within a population, you also have a moderator effect of the life history speed of the individual on the on the dimensionality of the trait. So in other words, when you have very high levels of K, very slow life history strategies, you also get a tendency for the correlations among these components to weaken, which means you have even more freedom, if you are an k strategist, to develop a specialized rep and behavioral traits, which gives you even more of an edge when it comes to finding specialized niches in the context of high con specific density environments.

Because don't forget, people who are very slow in life history orientation are highly tolerant of population density. They like living in dense environments like cities and areas where you have very, very large numbers of individuals and trying to cohabit. So the best way of dealing with this is to have what's called competitive release. So in other words, to avoid all of these individual people sort of competing for the same niche, they all go for specialized niches. And this character displacement leads to a massive increase in the carrying capacity.

If you look at the sort of ecological conditions that favor this, this character displacement, there are also the ecological conditions that favor high population density. And that's where you find all these k selected individuals trying to sort of get along and compete cooperatively with one another. And the net advantage of this, of course, is for the group. Any group that has high character displacement among its constituent individuals will benefit in competition with other groups, because that character displacement leads to an increase in comparative advantage. And this is an old concept that goes back to ricardo, the economist from the 1880s. But where you have high divisions of labor, you have high comparative advantage, which translates into high aggregate eco economic efficiency. Of competing groups. 

The flip side is you get this diversity, which works in these more complex ecologies, but people are going to be less, less lethal and impulsive in an unstable ecology, so they won't work quite as well there. 

So you have also, in addition to that, you favorite traits of favorite pro sociality, cooperation, lowtime preferences, tradeoffs, this sort of thing, allow people to ...
