Discussing upper limits on stable group selections, very intelligent deviation. Can that process be sped up? 

I think the only way we can sort of speed group selection up is consciously, ie, by deliberately stimulating it in some prosocial way, in a way that doesn't lead to massive amounts of death and conflict and genocide, etcetera, which are, which is the usual outcome of largescale group selection. So if you can find a way of making cattell's cooperative competition work, for example, then maybe you can have a form of group selection which is more stable and doesn't involve one group sort of murdering everything.

The only thing is, though, with the group selection malarkey, is that it's so complicated the different combinations that make a group selected society at the optimum levels. Is that something we can understand enough to do it, to get it right?

No, I don't think we can do a better job than nature. It's a very tricky balance, essentially.
