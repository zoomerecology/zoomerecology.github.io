To within the research area of ethno intelligence, what is the single most alarming specific subarea topic or paper done in this subarea topic out there, uh, that europeans should be alarmed by? For instance, is there something on europeans eventually becoming such a tiny minority as to be irrelevant, or something to that effect? 

I don't know that there's a any research that's indicated that they'll become such a tiny minority that they'll be irrelevant. But there's certainly a lot of research in there indicating that, on current trends, the percentage of, uh, european countries that is european, will decrease substantially.

Well, they keep revising these efforts. They from what i've been the race of the Uk. They've actually been, pushing the sort of replacement date forwards in time by a couple of decades. So basically it seems that, a lot of the calculations are based on the rate of replacement fertility among immigrant groups, which is, of course, contingent on those immigrant groups not attaining any kind of parity with the indigenous group in terms of fertility. So you have to assume that they're not subject to the demographic transition. 

The data that we have, seem to indicate that they are, in fact, somewhat influenced by the demographic transition. Their fertility rates are dropping as well. So that means that, uh, that rate at which one overtakes the other gets pushed further and further into the future. And I think the recent estimates sort of mean that, yeah. 

I also wondered two things are they pushing it into the future because the change is becoming so conspicuous now that it's invoking alarm. And so therefore, they feel they'd better, they'd better sort of pretend it's happening more slowly. That they used to glory in it. About 10 or 12, 15 years ago, you get articles in the garden that would wallow in it glory. Isn't it fantastic that white people will become a minority in America by this date? And now this, this idea is said to be a conspiracy theory, and something that shouldn't be talked about.

Well, I would just recommend reading the work of David Coleman at Oxford University, who is a very famous demographer who's written about this extensively. And he is probably the most credible source of information we have on the issue of whether there will be a demographic replacement event. And he is of the opinion that there will be. There's the old irish saying, which is that if nothing changes, everything will stay the same.

He's always been, over 20, 30 years, he's always been extremely calm about it. The media throw everything they can at David Coleman. Well, students have picketed him. There's all sorts of trouble caused by him periodically in the newspapers. Many years ago, um, I think he was, he was attacked as well. And I think every now and again, every 10 years or so, they attack him, he's just sort of calm and collected, and there's not a lot they can do about it.

I suppose another thing that they don't take into account in these calculations is the degree to which ethnic minorities become settled in the in the society. And become therefore more like the native population in their breeding patterns for that reason. So if you turn up on a society and you're right at the bottom of the pecking order, and you're nothing, then it incentivizes you to have lots of children. That the, r strategy is the only way forward, really. But the the having lots of children, that's the way forward if you're at the bottom. And once the groups such as hindus or whatever, move further up, this perhaps starts to change.
