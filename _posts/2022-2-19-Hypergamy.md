When will eugenics driven online dating catch on?

Well, I mean, there's surely there's a degree to which that is the essence of online dating, isn't it? People, in a sense, is is that not redundant? Is not all online dating more or less eugenic. I mean, i, I guess there might be people with weird, sort of dysgenics preferences, who want to mate with people with obvious problems. But I don't know, I thought most online dating was sort of fairly hypergamers aggressively. 

So, especially if you look at women, there's studies which have been done looking at women in terms of a degree to which they they rate the attractiveness of men. And the vast majority of men they rate as being below average in terms of attractiveness. Which sounds a bit weird, but it's true. There's a heavy right skew in their ratings of attractiveness. Most men they consider to be unattractive. Small number of men they consider to be above average. Whereas for men it's more even. In terms of how they rate female attractiveness, it's more sort of 50, 50, more of a normal distribution, rather than a left skewed distribution.

So so it seems that the hypergamy meme is very real, and women are, in fact, hypogammus, and they are very picky about males. And they do, they do tend to hold males to a much higher standard than males do females. So it could be argument women are more eugenically minded than males. And this is a good thing, I suppose, in terms of, you know, putting, putting the old pond skimmer through the gene pool.

But the flip side, they might also risk pricing themselves out of the mating market, which they tend to do when we reach a certain level of educational attainment. And, uh, this, of course, leads to dysgenics, which is quite a bit stronger in females than among males.

So particularly hispanic, particularly hispanic females, they are in very serious trouble as far as dysgenics is concerned. It's very sad. For more read our metaanalysis is a paper I did with Charlie Reeve and Michael Heaney in personality and individual differences, which I believe can be downloaded on research gates. It's our metaanalysis of dysgenic fertility. And we show that, yes, it's big race and sex differences. It seems if you're a hispanic woman, you're, uh, you know, you're very high iq. You're very unlikely to have children, which is, I think, very sad.

As you say, they price themselves out of the market, don't they? They, they, they want to marry hypergamously. They've got themselves into a situation where they're more educated than males, and it leads, at least in many western countries, in all scandinavian countries, for example, they're more educated than males. They want to marry hypergamists in terms of education. 

So what tends to happen is, in Finland it's very noticeable, you'll get the woman that goes for a bit of rough, but maybe that bit of rough earns more than than her, but, but he's, you know, he's not as educated. So there's a woman on my road, and she's a music teacher or something, and and her husband's, I know, some kind of, I work for the building site, kind of chat. Um, you get this again and again, actually, that the man is earning with a plumber earns more, but he's educated, so I can't see what they have to talk about. But maybe she doesn't want to.
