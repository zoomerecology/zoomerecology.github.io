Paul Vasey, who's one of the leading sort of experts on the evolution of Androphilia, as it's known in evolutionary psychology circles. And we're looking at the phylogenetic correlates of what we call samesex genital interactions. And this is one of the strongest predictors we find across phylogenetic distances. So this is involving an analysis of huge numbers of different primate species, and we look at the phylogeny, and we use, we look and see what predicts the variation across phylogenetic time is, in fact, sociality. So it seems that a), it's highly evolutionarily conserved, which is interesting. Which means differences between the phyla arise very early on in cladogenesis. So, it's something that's conserved across clades. It's something that changes very little, and very rarely. And when it does, it changes the sort of beginning or inception of evolutionary divergence. As for its course, whatever the evolutionary cause of it, it relates to sociality.

One possibility is it does relate to submission, which is consistent with what you're saying. And the primates which have members who are willing to engage in this sort of submissiveness, sexual submissiveness, are groups which are actually more able to survive intergroup competition when they are defeated. Because what it seems to be is a lot of this behavior is dominance behavior, whereby the males from the dominating group of a completely successful competitor group, uh will accept this uh gesture from certain males in the defeated group as a token of submission, and will, therefore the anger is abated. And you actually see a certain similar thing in canines, although it doesn't take the form of the same sex genital interaction. It takes the form of a rollover gesture. So it's like a vulnerability gesture. But dogs, the defeated dog will will show its stomach, which is very vulnerable, if the attacker, the successful attacker, wants to rip its guts out. But simply doing this switches off the aggression, essentially. So it might be a similar sort of behaviour.
