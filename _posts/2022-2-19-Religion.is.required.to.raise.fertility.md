Can whites increase our birth rates in the absence of religion in a patriarchal society that respects male reproductive rights? Do we need religion?

The answer to that is, no, you you do need religion. And obviously you need, you need religion, either because religion is important and real in, you know, some metaphysical sense, to people's wellbeing and happiness. Or, and this is not necessarily a incompatible view, we are evolved towards devotion and faith as a means of increasing the amount of binding energy within a group, thus increasing the efficiency of the group in intergroup competition. So you always need religion. 

So far, nobody's really even able to come up with a viable substitute for religion as a source of sort of organic cohesion within social groups. So it seems that, given human metaphysical and genetic limitations, we very likely need religion, and will continue to need religion going forwards into the future.

First of all, people that don't have religion seem to have lower fertility. So they they will die out. Secondly, people who then the mediating factors, people that don't have religion tend to have higher mental instability. I don't necessarily causal, but they tend to have higher mental instability, higher depression, higher autism, higher all kinds of other things. Thirdly, groups that don't have religion, are less ethnocentric, are less likely to fight for their own interests and get selected out. 

This is actually a specific part of the brain called the anterior frontal cortex, which is associated both with religiousness and ethnocentrism. When you stimulate it with magnets, it elevates both. 

That that doesn't replicate. The God helmet stuff doesn't seem to replicate. I'm sick of these things. This wasn't gone helmet, but I'm this was quite a new thing, so it wouldn't have replicated yet, because no one's replicated it. Okay, well, there was, remember the God Helmet? They stuck Richard dawkins in one. He just didn't experience anything.
