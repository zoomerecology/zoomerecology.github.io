What happens when a large part of the population has toxoplasmosis, like France?

Well, you get city philosophies, Jack Derrida, Michelle Fuku. There's a chap over in prague at Charles University, called Jaroslav Flager. And he has spent the last 20 years trying to prove that toxoplasmosis causes all sorts of bizarre sort of personality traits to arise, like extreme forms of openness to experience. And this is the way the toxoplasma increases, or top the attacks of toxoplasma Gondii, which is the parasite, this is how it increases its uh likelihood of being transmitted. Because by making people more open, it makes people more venturesome as well, and more likely to want to interact with other people and seek out normal people and novel experiences, thus increasing its, uh likelihood of being transmitted. So that's his theory. And there's some evidence that people with toxoplasmosis have higher openness to experience, but that could be confounded with all sorts of things.

The french, I mean, the french are suicidal people. They're very high into pre depression for some reason. I don't know. It's an outlier in that sense, because normally, as you move south, people become happier. But they are a very, very lugubrious people. And this is reflected, I think, in the kind of philosophies they have. I also did that paper with Jan years ago on these differences in philosophy, and on the the kind of philosophy you get between countries, analytic philosophy. Northern Europe, northern countries, Britain, also scandinavia, analytic dominant. And then south and also germany.

France, massively dominant, idealism, based around moral realism and things like this. So there seems to be this border. And that border also correlates with with, high levels of suicidality and stuff. They want to kill themselves. They're into it. They're killing themselves. And then you get countries like Spain and Italy that don't produce much contemporary philosophy, so they're not really relevant. But Germany and France, idealism, suicide, us. Lower suicide, analytic philosophy. Interesting thing. 

So I don't know if toxoplasmosis is relevant, because I don't know what that's like in Germany. But in France, they eat rare steak a lot, don't they? This transmits, yes, that's how you get it belgian is by eating raw meat, steak tartare, which is actually a very nice meal.
