Discuss how age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex predict taste in music, and the general decaying quality of popular music, along with its wits along with it.

A friend of mine, he's adamant that we talk about some, uh, somebody, some called billy eyelash or something. He wants, he wants us to do a talk about someone called Billy Eyelash. This individual seems to write... their music is sort of inspired by demons and things. And they, you know, they, they put a lot of, like, satanic stuff into their music. 

This colleague of mine sort of implored me to look into this and do some kind of finegrained socioepistatic analysis. But I sort of spent five minutes looking at you know, looking at the wikipedia page of this this individual, and I just sort of came to a conclusion. This is, it is what people are listening to today then, particularly young people. Then there's, you know, there's no hope at all.

Classical music is associated with with higher iq, and listening to music with songs associated with low iq. Um. 

So somebody's just mentioned that that her music is heavily inspired by her nihilism. Yeah, it was the impression. It's basically just more of the same, just more of this, you know, rubbish modernity syndrome type stuff, right? 

So apparently we would get less into classical music, so basically, less into complex music, more into music like boom, boom, boom and singing. That seems to be the direction of the research I'm aware of on this. So music will become, well, as we see, I mean, as is happening, music is becoming, I would say, Kate Bush for example. I mean, you wouldn't get anything as good as that these days, would you? You you know, watering heights or whatever. You'd get, well, billy irish.
