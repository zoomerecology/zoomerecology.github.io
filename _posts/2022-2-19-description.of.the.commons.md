The idea of a society’s common property is more than merely infrastructure and services and whatever we are taxed to provide. The commons can be public or private and it can be a community effort or merely between neighbors. It’s also the motivation that keeps parks clean and allows people to walk around a city unmolested. It is the guy who doesn’t rake his grass clippings in storm drains and the neighbor who watches your house while you are on vacation – it is what motivates us as being accountable to ourselves and others. It’s why you were taught as kids to confess to your neighbor for breaking his window on accident. The commons is not only the social trust that motivates a civilized behavior that avoids imposing costs on others, it is the imperative of improving society by personal actions – a belonging and an inclusion into group trust.
