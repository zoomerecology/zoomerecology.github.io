If intelligence is 80 genetic, why are the australians, originally the low Iq drugs of british society, so much smarter, more attractive, friendlier and all around better people than the british?

It is true that their intelligence level is high. It's just under a hundred, which is, it was reasonably average. But that has to take into account the fact that it's only 76 percent of european descent. And, and if you look at the foreign population, is most of the rest. And so if you look at those who are native born, then on the pisa a few years ago, I seem to recall, they had the highest score of any in the world on just among the native born population. So, the native born population of one particular one of the one test.

Secondly, this idea that they are the dregs of society is a bit of a myth really. If we look into who was transported between the between, across the from the late 18th century, to the mid-19th century when they stopped transportation. It was people that were doing quite complex crimes, things like sheep stealing and, poaching, and things that involve a certain degree of planning and whatever. Of course, they're going to get caught. But what certainly it wasn't people that got drunk and pumped someone in the face. Those kinds of impulsive, low Iq crimes, were not dealt with by transportation.

The next thing is a lot of people that were transported were irish people who would then come to Mainland Uk. And, immigration in those contexts tends to be predicted by iq. So already we're dealing with a select population. And then once they tried to deal with the fact that the the the convicts were, uh, were four-fifths male. And so once they tried to deal with that fact by getting more women into the colony, then these people were had very high rates of literacy. So 80 percent of the of the convicts that came from the Uk. Of this of the free immigrants. Under this system where they tried to get more women into Australia, could read as against 48 of women back home in the mid 1800s. 

And then you've got lots and lots of wealthy immigrants, as early as the 1820s that were sent over, uh, and given large land grants and so based on having a significant amount of money. So it got to a point where these free immigrants were mainly female.

And then if you look at the where they were transported from within the Uk. They were the they were trained to be transported from the industrial centers. So from London, particularly from London. 10 to the population in 1850 lived in London. 20 of those transported. And from other large industrial centers. And these would have been people would have migrated from the countryside. The more intelligent people would have migrated into the large cities.

So my conclusion is that this idea that they were the dregs of british society is a bit of a myth. Really. They weren't the dregs of british society. Vast numbers of them weren't. At an early stage, weren't convicts at all. They were actually quite high Iq women. And those that were convicts were engaged in the kind of crime that is a bit like white collar crime, that involves planning, and that kind of thing.
