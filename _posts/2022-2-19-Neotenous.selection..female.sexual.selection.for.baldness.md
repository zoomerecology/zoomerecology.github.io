I understand why it is that like bushmen evolve, move away from blacks, and they become more neotenous, okay, um. And you can kind of that there would be some benefit in a different environment to that. But it seems that aborigines, australian aborigines, are related to, are descended from east asians, basically, from southeast asians, or proto southeast asians. And so it's rather odd that they have become less neotenous, much less neotomous. Um. And I don't understand what's, what's the, what's the the sort of process that causes it to go in the other direction? People say that evolution is underpinned by neotony but it's gone the other way with.

Neotony is just a a very, sort of mild version of a a broader phenomenon in evolution, which is called, Heterochromia. And heterochromia is basically the tendency to take features which are present at a very early stage of a life cycle. These are an organisms that have metamorphic life cycles. And actually retain those into adulthood. So for example, caterpillars, it's possible that some species might have actually lost the ability to metamorphose because there are advantages to not metamorphosing. So in other words, they live out their entire life cycle, including their reproductive life cycle, in this larval stage. So that's, you know, heterochromia is the bigger class of effects to which neotony belongs. neotony is just a very specialized case where you have organisms that don't metamorphose, but there are differences at different stages in life, of course, and those can be retained.

Now, it is perfectly possible to have an opposing regime of selection, where you actually select to exaggerate traits associated with older age or more advanced age. It's just rarer because usually older age is associated with generally lower system integrity, right? So anything that signals older age is not necessarily going to be something that signals fitness. Usually it's things that are present when you're young, like having, you know, wrinklefree skin, and having a, you know, a good hairline, or having brown hair or whatever, you know, and blue eyes, rather than having, say, you know, gray hair and like leathery skin.

This is an idea i've been working on, that males, in human human males are subject to sexual selection from females, I believe, for nonneonic traits. I believe that there actually have been under sexual selection, at least at some point in their recent history, by the last 100 000 years or so, for the opposite, for traits associated with old, older age and maturity. So, for example, beards. There are studies showing that beards in males increase female ratings of facial attractiveness considerably. And females actually don't like males without beards, because they look, in their own, quote, this baby face.

Apparently the babyfaced look is very offputting to a lot of women, based on these phases in history, such as the 14th century or a medieval film where everyone doesn't have beards, yeah. Also having a, having a, you know, a receded hairline, or even being bald. At some point in the history of men, that had to be highly attractive. For whatever reason, that had to be highly attractive, otherwise there'd be no androgenic alopecia in men.
