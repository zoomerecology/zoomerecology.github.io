Is SAT good test for g?

It is a very good test for G. Certainly the original sat. Actually, Douglas Determan, who's a very famous intelligence researcher, who for the longest time was a, uh, editorinchief, of Journal intelligence, not the journal of intelligence, it's a different journal.

But yes, Doug dettman was actually one of the first people to do a very solid analysis of the gloading of the sat. And what he found was that it's very highly correlated performance on which is very highly correlated with other standardized Iq tests, with Gpa, with the gat, with the mcats, with the lsats, with all the other sort of scholastic attainment measures, with standard Iq tests. But yes, it's actually very good. And in terms of G loading, the Vocab, the verbal ability scale, uh, the verbal component on the old system, I know there's like a third component. I couldn't tell you what the g loading is of that. But when I did the sat, there were just two components. There was like a verbal and a quantitative the verbal component is much more highly gloaded than the quantitative component. And admissions tutors and things that universities pay at the league. Universities, believe it or not, pay more attention to your verbal your sat v, than they do your sat m. Because your sat v is a better predictor of performance in university as a student then Sec when your sat m score is. And that's because of a different in the g.
