Which countries, as a brit would you say, are on average most related to me than Britain at this time? 

Which group of people in Europe say, are more closely related to the british than any other group? The answer to that is, well, it depends on where in Britain you're from. If you're a sort of anglo, then it's probably going to be Danes, if you're some scando type.

If you're a scot, it's going to be irish people, obviously, If your Welsh people. welsh, same as brits. Same with cornish. Any anything celtic is going to be more irish clustered. What about bretons. Well, there's sort of an interesting group. They're also more celtic. I believe I might be completely wrong about that, but I always thought it was more sort of celtic type group.
