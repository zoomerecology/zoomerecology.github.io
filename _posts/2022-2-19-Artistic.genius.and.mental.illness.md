Are artistic genius mental illness related?

The answer to that is yes. There are a number of very famous artists, who Van Gogh, picasso, who all had a history of mental illness. And the sorts of mental illnesses these people had were things like depression, schizophrenia. And some milder manifestations of schizophrenia are associated with heightened creative ideation and the and what you could call sort of promiscuous mixing of the senses in an almost synesthesia type way, which can lead to novel ways of representing objects, through different artistic modes and styles. And this is sort of one of the benefits, maybe, of having a little mental illness in the population. This is, by the way, is Dan Nettle's thesis. His theory is the creativity and mental illness are quite closely coupled to one another, especially is most pronounced in the case of artistic creatives and innovations. Theory a paper in about 1994 by somebody called Post in the british journal of psychiatry. And he showed that the the more artistic that it looked at 291 commonly recognized eminent men. And it looked at levels of psychopathology, among them, levels of narcissism and levels of mental illness that it found that these, it's definitely so that being a great artist, and particularly, I think, actually little cited, and particularly art, the actual painting and so on, but to a lesser extent, poetry and even just writing, even journalists, is predicted by mental instability. Whether it's neuroticism or, to some extent, schizophrenia, my understanding is that it's not schizophrenia in itself. It's schizotypal personality, or aspects thereof.

Yes, it's schizotypal, but that it sort of can shade into schizophrenia that kind of painted cats.

And so it could be argued that there should be an optimum level of mental illness, as it were, in the population. And equally, if you look at shamans, and shamans perform this group selected trait of inspiring the population and making and performing miracles for them and making them feel that they're the best and the gods are looking after them and all this kind of thing. And those shamans tend to be violently mentally ill, according to anthropological research.
