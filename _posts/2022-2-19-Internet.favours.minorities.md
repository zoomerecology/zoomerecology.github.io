Do you think the internet has a positive effect on case election and ethnocentrism? Does the internet favor the majority of the population, or its small minorities within a population?

I i suppose it favors people who are a minority in any way. So in the old days, if you were unusual, in any way, then you'd just be unusual, and you'd be isolated, and it would be quite difficult and complicated and nervewracking, um, to try and get in touch with other people like you. Whereas now you can easily find other people like you. Now, on the one hand, and create these niches, these niches like like, perhaps like we've, we've created here in this channel. 

Now, on the one hand, it could be argued that's, that's a good thing, sort of, psychologically, assuming that what you're doing is a sort of adaptive and useful and healthy thing, because it means that you're less isolated, and you can make friends more easily and and that sort of thing.

On the other hand, it means that if you are a maladaptive, spiteful mutant type, then you could more easily, as we perhaps discussed, was it last week, you can more easily find other people like you who will then the the previous to the internet, there was a protection against you finding other weirdos that would, that would back up how you felt, uh, and and becoming a weird, isolated weirdo among other weirders. So, that's a bad thing about the the internet in terms of, in terms of minorities. So it seems to me it's good and bad.

As for does it favor the majority or the minority? I suppose it favors the minority in the sense that there is something quite democratic about the internet. And that's why they want to clamp down on youtube, and they have done, and clamp down on twitter and all this kind of thing, because it is undermining the power of the majority in society. Uh, it's, it's so, it's, it's a problem. 

That's why China is so paranoid about it. That's why China heavily restricts the internet. In, what's that uh area called where the Uyghur live, that zing Yang, or something, that region, they heavily restrict the internet there because they don't want them communicating.

Let's compare it to the rise of printing. Printing caused the majority those that were in charge of the the societies that basically lose control. And you had the popular reformation, and they had to clamp down on it with the magisterial reformation. And and so so, yeah, I think there's two sides to it. 

Yes, I agree. I agree with you. I think it's a, uh, I think it's a sort of a, it's a doubleedged sword.
