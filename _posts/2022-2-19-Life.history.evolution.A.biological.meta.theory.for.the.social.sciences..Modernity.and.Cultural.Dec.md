Currently reading Life history evolution A biological meta theory for the social sciences.

It's a meta theory for the social sciences. So the idea is that life history theory can be used as a lens, essentially, through which you can understand the writings of various prominent historic historians, philosophers, scientists, sociologists, psychologists, etc. So we sort of collected together 30 or 40 prominent names and, and looked at their bodies of work and sort of distilled from those bodies of work those elements which are clearly related to life history theory. We kind of used it to show that people intuit life history theories. So they, they just kind of rock it, you know, they get it at this very fundamental level. And even if they don't have the explicit framework, they they still see it. They see tradeoffs. They see, you know, the archetypes of life history and everything. So we just wanted to make that point. But it is really a sort of a good synthesizing framework for understanding social science and philosophy and things like that.

But the new book is I think, better. I think he's much more clearly written than the life history book, which I think is sort of unnecessarily prolics in places. This new book is, is coming up with the same publishers, um, and it will be out at the end of the month. And it's a book on civilizational decline. And it's a book that looks at the historical and, historical record and also the empirical records. We conduct several new analyses in there to show that all of these different strands of evidence are consistent with the social epistasis amplification model having played a very central role in civilizational decline, at least in the west. And having played an even more central role in the demographic transition, which we demonstrated emperically, we have data on this.

The final chapter, which I think is going to be interesting to some, we call biocosmic pessimism. And we sort of extend the social epistasis amplification model to the question of the fermi paradox and the socalled great silence. And we try to sort of promote it as a potential solution to fermi's paradox.
