Could zombie films be a subconscious fear of multiculturalism made into acceptable form of art? 

I have this idea about witches. I'm much more familiar with the witch literature than I am with the zombie literature. So I can't tell you much about the origin of zombies, or werewolves, or all these kinds of possessed things. These multiculturalist nutters do seem rather like zombies. They seem, they don't have a brain. They seem, they seem possessed. They are Automaton. They, they are aggressive. They destroy civilization. Um. So in that sense, i, as you could argue, they're kind of like zombies. 

You've just rediscovered the Npc Meme meme.

They are the Npc Meme type people. And there's a small group of people that are in these films that are but my favorite one is that one with that guy, what's his name, Simon Nye. It's a kind of spoof zombie film about 15 years ago, 15 years old or something. Hot fuzz.
