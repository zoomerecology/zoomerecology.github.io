Could religion should encourage group selection? Many minorities are christian, and many christians argue, we're all God's children. Well, I think religion has become mutated. It's the spiteful mutant model. They've got their webbed hands on everything including the institutions of the society that are adaptive. They undermine religion substantially. But they've also pushed it in so that the church of England now is just basically marxism and a mitre or multiculturalism in a mitre. So that the church of Sweden put out a tweet saying that greta turnburg was the new Jesus Christ.

Yes, I'd say that religion reflects the genotypes that practice it. And christianity is largely a function of the more reproductively successful genotypes having outbred less reproductively successful ones. Puritans, for example, were very reproductively successful, which is why protestantism took off and derivatives of protestantism became dominant. And we had for 30 years war.

The point is that the the church now, and that's the point for mutants in positions of power inside the church. Maybe in the swedish church in particular, what you're saying is true. That sounds like, you know, demon levels of heresy. Then they're basically, yeah, they're just enthralled to these terrible people. I mean, they have a lot of women bishops in Sweden, and equally, what you see with these, I think, these private campaign of people is you see the most calvinist aspects of of calvinism with the the religious aspects taken out, so with the belief in God and the belief in truth and things like this gone. It's just the bad aspects of calvinism. There's just the moral signaling and the the the belief in destiny and the certainty and the further.

And so you just have this awful situation as I said, they've occupied smithfield meat market. What do you call them? Extortion, rebellion or whatever? I was saying that it wasn't, you know, 500 years ago or so, at the time, for Queen Mary, Puritans were led to smithfield meat market to be burned at the stake. Nero made them, these puritans never made them into candles, in the human candles nearby, yes? Nero, the emperor nero, which, well, christians. You mean early christians, right?
