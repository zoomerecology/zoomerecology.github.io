Isn't the purpose of elite universities to teach the world in class politics that makes social justice a feature, not a bug?

 It has historically been a purpose of universities for some universities, Joanna Williams, she looked at the history of universities. And, yes, in Britain, the the purpose of universities was basically to educate the ruling class as a kind of finishing school. You'd go there to be the kind to be trained as a priest or to read law and later medicine. And those were really the only two subjects there. For a long time, it was law and theology.

And so and in that sense, yes, it was about inculcating the rule, the young ruling class with certain values. Offered university in the 1500, early 1500s, they taught you things like dancing and, how to chat up girls and this this kind of stuff and physiography that was on the course at oxford until Henry VIII banned it for being associated with gypsies. It was a finishing school for for the upper class. So in that sense, it inculcated them with the values of the ruling class. 

That was the purpose of university. For a very long time, this is why most serious research, most scientific research, took place outside of the university, among independent scholars. Because that wasn't the point of the university. The university wasn't about original knowledge. The university was about England. It was run by the church of England of church. Anyway, until 1871, you had to be a clergyman in order to be an academic at the University of Oxford more than three years. You had to be ordained. You had to be a clergyman in order to be a fellow. You had to be church of England in order to be student there at all.

Now, in Germany, it was a bit different. In Germany, much earlier on, universities were different. They were about kind of science and knowledge and getting to the truth and things like that, much earlier than was the case in Britain. And it was in the victorian period the british universities kind became more german, if you like, and became more than simply about inculcating the upper class with the values of the upper class, as you say, like an extension of public school, but also about this idea of more more, this ideas of continental idea, really, this sort of idea that was more the case on the continent of universities being having this idea of unveiling, unveiling God's revelation, things like that. That was there in british universities to some extent, but it was, it was more prominent this idea of getting the truth in Germany. And we've merged the two.

So I would argue that we're going back to what universities were like in about 1700 in England. And I don't think that's a good thing. 

But I would say that this proclivity, especially for the most elite universities, to train, um, future, uh, you know, few future ruling elites, essentially, is something that's always been a component of elite universities. However, what I would say is that one of the big changes that's characterized university culture in in the 20th century and the 21st century is a move away from the idea that there's a specific track within elite universities, or there are specific subjects which are designed specifically to sort of culture, you know, inculcate, or culture these elite individuals, to the idea that this, there's a kind of mission creep so that it's not just the elite rhetorics are not just restricted to specific causes like PPE or politics, philosophy and economics, at Oxford, for example. But now the sort of underlying, you know, the regnant ideologies are spreading outwards into other fields. Fields as far removed from from from politics, philosophy and economics, as things like the life sciences.

The idea is that now all subjects are subject to this kind of **ideological litmus test**, and that all individuals being trained in all these subjects have to, you know, **demonstrate the appropriate degree of commitment to the regular pieties and knowledge of the associated shibboleths**, etc. And, it's not simply that only the elite who are being trained specifically for positions of government need to know this stuff. It's now everyone who has any shot of getting into any kind of elite activity, you know, who's involved in any kind of elite cultural production, even if it has nothing to do with politics, like science, for example, has to be on board with the basic elite agenda. And I'd say it's that diffusion outwards. So in other words, you could, you could say it's the, you know, the the PPE-ization of other fields within elite universities that is characteristic.

There has been this expansion of who has to say they agree with the state ideology in order to be acceptable. I think that's true. And the state has expanded as well. But there's been this expansion of that. So now it's going lower, lower and lower down the social scale, who've got to declare... there was some case recently on twitter of a a restaurant that was hiring and or something, and it's having its menu a mission statement of how it was committed to diversity. And you get schools that do this, not just the organs of the state.

I know the the the former version of this culture occult was, of course, in England, anyway. It was the church of England. And so you had to, you had to ascend that you were you had to state that you were committed to the church of England. You the how many articles it is you had in order to to become a student. And you had to be even more committed, you had to go to mass once a week, or whatever, if you wanted to be with any chance of being a fellow. 

And then that was stopped 1870. That was all stopped, um, and, and there was no commitment to go to university. Now, maybe that at that point, then politics, philosophy and economics gradually develops as a separate degree.

The point is that there's, it's got ups and downs. There's been periods where the universities have been about truth, and there have been periods where they've been less about truth. For example, the universities were quite free. Um, in the late medieval period, they were reasonably free to do what they wanted. And then in the reformation, then they were kind of clamped down. And then, and so you get this kind of variation. And now I think we're just in a particularly unfree point in universities. Let's say there's this mission creep, where now all of these people have to, including scientists to get a job there at all, they have to at least pretend to do lip service to this, this this ideology.

Yes, that's right. And you you could, you could argue that this rhythm, essentially is a function of uh, the degree to which the selection pressures are favoring certain traits and disfavoring others. So it could be, for example, but under a regime where you have high levels of individual level selection, where people are not necessarily selecting for high g they might be selecting for other traits, perhaps traits related to slow life history, like conscientiousness. Then what you want is, you want, you want a populace, that is, you want your elite to be able to signal, but they can comply with regular pieties and not think too much about them. 

So you want, you want to, you want an elite group that's not necessarily very smart, but you want them to be able to, you know, signal their high diligence and their high conscientiousness and sort of dutifulness to whatever sort of sacralized social mission your society is undergoing at that point. So you can link this, perhaps, to broader patterns of selection, but that's just me. I tend to **link everything to broader patterns of selection**
