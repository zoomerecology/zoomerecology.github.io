So could century antiusury laws be a sign of high group selection? Is there a link between monetary mass and rk variations?

The century laws is a very interesting question, because the more K selected a society is, the more niches it has, the more you have division of labor. And if you want to maintain a division of labor and maintain a clear hierarchy, one of the ways you can do that is through clothes and differences in how people dress, so everybody knows where everybody is, and nobody's pretending, and everybody's kind of honest about who they are and what a contribution they are making to the super organism. And so that's very interesting. Yes, something laws could be a way of stamping that into into law.

I think I actually wrote that in a book. I think I actually discussed that very issue of how laws, like sumptuary laws, um are basically exactly as you point out. They're a mechanism through which high social signaling, honesty and social signaling, can be maintained. And therefore they they function very strongly in terms of reinforcing social distinctions between people, which are necessary for the organic functioning of the group.

They prevent willful attempts at playing for status by lying about what you've achieved. Um, of course, there's going to be a subjectivity to them and where the borders lie.
