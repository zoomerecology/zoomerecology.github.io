Iq decreased prior to contraception, and that easier ecologies prompted decline. Is that true?

Yes, yes, it is absolutely. The Iq decline would have started not with the advent of contraception. Contraception was just a a moderator. It increased the rate of the of the Iq decline um. But prior to that, you have increasing global temperature means and decreasing variance of global temperatures, which means that you have lower levels of extrinsic, that's uncontrollable morbidity and mortality. Now who is more vulnerable in the population to extrinsic morbidity and mortality? People with low Iq, socially vulnerable people, not people with high iq, who can resist these things and control these these these uncontrollable universities, these uncontrolled factors for people who have problems dealing with this are people with low ability, people who can't inceptively niche construct and regulate their environments, as well as people with high ability.

So the mediating factor is group selection. So the colder climates encourage group selection because you have ecological scarcity and unpredictability, which causes groups to expand into more clement environments where you have more reliable and predictable resources. This is why you have northern populations living in unforgiving environments expanding into southern, more temperate environments, essentially so they can take those more plentiful and more abundant resources. You know, tea from India, coffee from China, opioids from China, Et cetera, Et cetera. So, so this is the thing, all the stuff you don't have in your own country, all the, you know, the the goods, etc, you can get from these other countries where it's more clement and more stable and predictable.

But essentially, the other thing about group selection is, of course, it puts populations under stress. Groups tend to be very beastly to one another, particularly conquering groups. Uh, to the conquered group, you tend to have high levels of mortality. Who's more likely to die in intergroup conflict? Again, it's going to then.

Why is it that once that, once that pressure is reduced, then they, then they seem to develop contraception? Well, the contraception comes later. The contraceptive why? The reason is because it is, contraception is not something that all high iq populations have had. And it's in the case of some populations which have undergone historical decline, such as the Greeks, there was no contraception. There was just a desire to not have children, which was satiated by simply avoiding having children using other means.

So rather than direct contraception, they didn't have prophylactics, they didn't have vulcanized rubber, you know, they didn't have any other things to produce reliable contraception. They might have these rhythm methods. They might have, you know, they might have been engaged in non sort of procreative sexual acts, or a lot of alternative ways of, you know, having sex without having offspring. So essentially this might have been a factor in the decline of these, these high iq, pre contraceptive civilizations.

But the the ultimate pressures on these populations would have stemmed from changes in the patterns of extrinsic morbidity and mortality and in the shift from group selection to individual selection. This distally would have been a more significant factor. Contraception in the west was a product of innovation, stemming from the fact we had an industrial base with the ability to mass produce consumer goods. And, as Richard Lynn says, you know, but one of the biggest factors that would have contributed to the Iq decline is the vulcanization of rubber. Vulcanization of rubber, of course, being a necessary, precursor technology to the mass production.

The temperature getting higher, basically, or reduced group selection, then seems to manifest in them not wanting to have babies. Basically, if you have mild ecologies, and you have, you have ecologies in which the mortality is generally lower. So in other words, all babies born likely to survive, rather than most babies born don't survive, as was the case historically in Europe, where you had sort of infant and child mortality rates of 50, 60 in some cases. We have good data on France. We have good data on sweden from the 17th, uh, basically the 16th and 17th centuries infant and child mortality.
