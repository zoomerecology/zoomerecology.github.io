Could super intelligent ai continue as g declines?

I think that it really depends on what we mean by super intelligent. And I think that if by super intelligent ai you mean artificial general intelligence, then we're really making no sustained progress towards that goal. In fact, the intelligence research community, artificial intelligence research community, most of them don't even believe in G. So their idea of making an intelligent system is to have one which is better able to do pattern recognition. And to build pattern recognition systems, you don't necessarily need high levels of the general ability you just means what these machines can't do is solve any arbitrary problem that's presented to them. So, so we're really not that, not nearly. Well, we're nowhere near getting artificial general intelligence to any significant degree. There are a small number of researchers who deserve to be singled out for actually taking the question of artificial general intelligence, seriously, such as Peter boss. Another one would be, uh, Ben Gertzel. They seem to be making progress in this area. But they seem to be of a sort of minority persuasion, unfortunately. So most of what, most of what you're sold as Ai is not really eye right? It's artificial cognitive specialization, like artificial being able to, uh, you know, recognize a snow leopard against a backdrop of rocks or something. It's, it's got nothing to do really with intelligence. It's just a sophisticated kind of logistic regression. So to really have a machine intelligence that was capable of picking up the slack and doing, uh, sort of human type cognitive heavy lifting, it would need to be an artificially, generally intelligent, not just an artificially intelligent, machine intelligence. And we, we're nowhere near, sort of realizing that goal, unfortunately. So for the time being, the immediate, sort of, foreseeable, huge answer to that question is no.
