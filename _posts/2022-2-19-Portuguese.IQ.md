Why do the portuguese have a low iq? In the past, whether europeans? 

So first of all, we can just look in terms of the kind of broad, sort of civilic way of cold winter's theory plus group selection. Portugal is, of course warmer. Our basic needs are met to a greater extent than in northern Europe, and so on that basis alone, you would expect Portugal to have a lower iq than parts of northern Europe.

It used to be thought that the iq was much lower than that of Spain. It was like an estimated 92, and Spain was put at like 98. But according to the linen becca Book, Spain is 95 and Portugal is 93. So the difference is not that large.

A second issue, according to Richard Lynn anyway, is that there were very large number of slaves, of african slaves, in portugal, particularly southern portugal, in the early modern period, very large numbers of them. And these kind of integrated into the population. And so this would have reduced Iq. And I'm glad you mentioned it, because I was writing about portuguese iq only today, actually.

A third issue just just occurred to me as I read this was, um, I don't know, alvaro, you would know more about this than me, but I wonder about the extent of immigration to Brazil. And that that presumably would have been more intelligent portuguese that would have gone to Brazil. And as I understand it, there was a period of time where Portugal was just in kind of political chaos, basically. And the crown, I mean, the royal family, the government, basically went to Brazil. And the portuguese empire was run from Brazil, which presumably would have attracted more intelligent people to Brazil. And so I wonder about that in terms of the portuguese Iq. So kind of like the effect of the irish. Would there have been strong immigration to Brazil? Calls it reducing the iq of those left behind. So that's my suggestions.
