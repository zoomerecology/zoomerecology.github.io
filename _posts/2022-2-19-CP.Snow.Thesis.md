It was an excellent work, and i, I do like the, you know, the basic premise of it, um. But it explains neatly this, this sort of deep decomposition, essentially, of the academia and nonacademia into broadly speaking, sort of liberal and conservative pursuits. And as a model, it, it kind of works to explain the, the appeal that academia has to the left, the left. The left can use it as well the leveraging power of affecting social change, of doing all the sort of activism things that they want to do. It's a very good soapbox for them. It is a very good vehicle that operates outside of the market, through which they can basically promote their ideological agenda without necessarily having to suffer economic consequences through lack of demand, as might be the case with market actors, for example, who, if they do something the market doesn't like, they lose money as a consequence and have to sort of go away and rethink. And academia protects these people from the sort of consequences of their actions as well. Um, and, yeah, it's, it's, obviously, the thesis is much more elaborate than that, but it's a nice idea, and it's quite an early attempt to sort of account for this, uh, this social sorting into these different niches of these different political phenotypes as well. It's a good... Cp snow, I thought, I think is a very brilliant person, very brilliant writer.
