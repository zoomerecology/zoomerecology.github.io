I've got this absolutely crazy idea I want to put out there. Okay, based on this idea that there's kind of like this, this infectious effect of a social genome that is composited in a certain way, on other genomes that sort of come into its sphere of control, you know, biased social epistasis. And I have this theory that it's not just humans that should be showing mutation accumulation due to relaxed, purifying selection. It should also be other things that are part of our portmanteau biota, such as our domesticates, our cattle, our varieties, our crops, and things like this.

Bees, for example, colony collapse in bees, to what extent could this actually be due to um deficiencies in ape culture? That's it, that's the culturing of bees, essentially like farming bees. And to what extent could problems in agriculture be leading to accumulation of spiteful mutations, which are starting to induce colony collapse? 

I came across a very, very interesting paper, which, believe it or not, was published by a young earth creationist. He happened to be a very brilliant chap over at Cornell University who invented the gene gun sanders, I think his name was. But he has this theory that the genome is decaying, and you can kind of use this to prove that humans are very young species, and when they're older than 6 000 years or whatever, it's all garbage. But he did find something very interesting, and paper, but got into a serious journal. And that is, he noted that human flu influenza strains sampled from back to 1918, when you had that big outbreak of spanish flu, have shown two strains he looked at, based on Strain libraries, have shown systematic mutation accumulation over decades and decades. Both of these strings, as h1, ends something rather another strain as well, a similar sort of Strain Name. But he showed mutation accumulation. Of course, he says, oh, this is proof that the mutations are overwhelming with darwinian mechanisms, and therefore, you know, evolution can't be doesn't real. Right?

But what if these endo parasites, which is what viruses are with their exclusivity in terms of their human associational pattern. Because these are not zoonotic diseases. These are, we now have an exclusive association with humans. What if these strains are picking up mutations from our genome, or are being exposed to mutagenic factors, you know, factors in our own environment which are inducing mutagenesis? In other words, they're picking up unstable genes from the human genome, and they're trying to build themselves out of unstable genes. So as a result, they kind of become degraded by mutation, loaded by proxy.

We breed dogs, we breed cats, and so we, we want the best? We're not breeding for survival ability. We're breeding for them looking nice, or whatever.

Ryan Scott John Sanford, that's the name of the chap, and he's a very smart man. I'm not running him down. He invented the gene gun, which is a method for ballistic transfer of genetic elements into plants, Cornell University. Very smart guy, but he's one of these creationists. And his, uh, but he has collected interesting data. And the data on the viral genome instabilities is absolutely fascinating. And I'm thinking of sort of working this up into a more formal theory.

You'd be saying, sorry, can I just interject? You'd be saying that kind of, we'd be getting worse at farming. Would be making more stupid decisions, more weird decisions in farming our animals, and thus the pig would get more mutated?

Another possibility is that we don't practice strong, purifying selection that is a component of our constructed niche. So what I'm saying is, in the same way that we, we tend to, within our own affairs do everything we can to remove the, you know, the surgeon's knife of darwinian selection, essentially. So we allow these patients to build up. We our niche is designed essentially to buffer against um mutation dependent mortality. We have things built into our niche which explicitly control that source of extrinsic mortality. Issues will build up, right? Yeah. To what extent could anything that's within our purview, right? Anything that's part of our niche? And to what extent could we also be buffering those attacks against the full sort of edge we take.

If you have a horse that has a, as a farmer, if you have a horse, and that horse has a, uh, I don't know, a difficult birth, and the fold dies and it's hanging back of her, then normally she'd get she'd get infected, and she'd die. But you don't, you you, yeah, she gets sepsis. So you remove the foal, and then she has more babies.

And also with, with, uh, with varieties of corn and things like this, we now, we have fertile npk fertilizers. We have cloud fields.

We protect them. All the insects have gone. Remember in the 80s, when you don't hold those devon or something, and your windscreen, if you covered dead flies. And now you and now you don't see them. They're all dead. They don't breed. They're all killed by insecticides and things. No flies there, right? 

The killing due to insecticides is also very interesting, because it's indiscriminate, yes? So there's very little selection there, except the insecticide resistance, of course. But I don't strategy flies. What sort of an effect would that have on the genome? We're thinking more about varieties and domesticates and things which are part of or parasites. That would mean that these baby flies, these grubs, were being nurtured less. And then there'd be a kind of, a, kind of a mouse utopia situation with the with the baby flies, exactly. 

This is a bigger theory is having about the that you get beautiful one flies. You get female flies, like begging male flies for sex, and them not wanting it because they've got a robot fly.
