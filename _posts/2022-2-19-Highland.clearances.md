Did the hiding clearances kill Scott's ingenuity? 

I think there were a lot very interesting families in the period of the island, in the period of the highland clearances, who ended up fighting on the wrong side, the jacobite side, essentially, and who ended up suffering as a consequence. And these were both sort of lowland families who were catholic and had, who had jacobite leanings, like my own family, who were catholic and had jacobite leanings, and also, families who were basically highly true highlanders, almost ethnically a different group, gaelic scots. And it's interesting,

I think most of the eminent scots came from the lowlands. I think they came from the sort of big city areas like glasgow and,  edinburgh and, those sort of areas, borderlands, places like that. I don't think there were huge numbers from inverness and the highlands region and all this sort of thing. 

It was a lot more backwards in the highlands for a very long period of time. We know this. There are reports of travelers in the Uk. Who went on these long walks through different parts of the Uk. In the 18th century, and they're describing these almost, um, surreal sort of scenes that they are encountering in going through the highlands, and encountering the locals and things, and being chased around by people with you to ski and do, which was a sort of ceremonial knife that Scott's carried.

It was another world, even in the 18th century, even after the act of union. And that entire culture has been virtually eliminated through, through the clearances, which was a real tragic thing. That shouldn't have happened. But that, again, group selection. You know, that's an example of group selection. The lowland scots and their allies in in England, the Sassen act, essentially were victorious in that particular conflict. And they eliminated the group which was producing the most rebellion.

And you've got to keep in mind with three separate attempts by scottish catholics to actually take over England. There were three separate attempts. You had the James the second post exile, his son, the old pretender James the socalled james the eighth of Scotland, and his son, Bonnie, Prince Charlie. There were three separate attacks, three separate attempts. Now, the last one was in the 1740s rather.

He probably would have won if you hadn't turned back at it's entirely possible that that could have happened.
