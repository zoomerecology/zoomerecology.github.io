What they showed was that there's a certain kind of personality that's associated with being a criminal. There is essentially a criminal personality of low agreeableness and low conscientiousness and the low impulse control and the mental instability and this kind of thing. And that kind of personality is strongly um heritable. And they estimated, based on something called the breeders equation, that about two percent of the male pop before about 100, there was an execution going on. There was no sterilization in that sense, young men who murdered people or who committed crimes, weren't killed. They were simply allowed to battle it out with the the family who they'd wronged, or pay a fine to that family. That was that was the system in Anglosaxon. The church were against execution. And so it didn't happen. 

And gradually, as as the medieval period came along, then suddenly this view developed, the the good should be removed, the bad should be removed, should be killed, basically so the good could live in peace, because there wasn't the infrastructure to have prisons really, and things like this. They didn't do it in any great way. And so that's what started to happen. And by the high middle ages in England and other european countries as well, all felonies carried the death penalty. So all crimes that originally had involved the confiscation of property carried the death penalty. You could get out of this death penalty if you had high iq, or if you had high social class, basically. And high social classes predicted by Iq and by personality. And then you if you could read, for example, you could do benefit of the clergy, and you could avoid being executed. You could be outlawed instead. And so what they estimated was about two percent of the male population being killed every generation by being executed or by being killed at the scene of the crime, or dying in prison being held before trial. And those would have been the more psychopathic component of the population. And therefore it was altering the european personality in a more prosocial direction.

And they demonstrated with this complex system of maths I can't really tell you much about, that's indeed the case. Then myself and guy developed this, and we argue that it would also be elevating intelligence, because when the consequences of of criminality are so severe, you'd have to be very stupid to to to engage in it and to get caught and to get into even so on. So they've almost certainly have been killing low intelligence people, because criminality is associated with low iq. And then myself and guy Madison showed that it would also have been elevating religiousness. We demonstrated this, and we showed with the personality factors associated with religious and criminal and negatively criminality. And we showed that religiousness does indeed increase across the medieval period, we do actually become more religious. So by reintroducing execution, indeed, sterilization for the lower for these criminals, we would indeed be elevating a prosocial, high intelligence and religious traits.

Basically, some of you are probably familiar with the work of levitt and dunbar. They wrote a book called freekoeconomics and sequel called super freekoeconomics. And in this book, it was argued for a thing they called the crime abortion connection. And the way the crime abortion connection worked was a lot of mothers could capitalize on Roe v Wade ie legalized abortion as a way of getting rid of babies who might be raised in environments that were criminogenic. So their argument was it was environmental. These babies were going to get born into a poor environment, and the environment was going to sort of inculcate them in the ways of criminality.

But if you look at the heritability of criminality, as frost and harpending describe in their work, is around point four. Point five is sort of average for the heritability of traits. And I have argued that actually, there is still capital punishment. It's for precrime. And I found quite robust data actually, showing that criminality is one of the strongest predictors of your likelihood of having had an abortion. We have some good data on it. It's unpublished, but, the suggestion is that a lot of the execution essentially takes place in utero now, and, abortion is the main vector. It's eugenic in the sense that, yes, it reduces the frequency of variance for criminality.

But here's the kicker, it does not correlate with iq. Correlation between abortion numbers and iq. I put out a paper on that, two years ago, in personality and individual differences. And I looked for it every which way. You could imagine different ethnic groups, combining them, splitting them out, fitting curves, doing negative binomial regressions, every you know, everything you can imagine. Just big load of nothing. I hope you're hearing this, if you're watching. We were talking about this earlier. I was of the view that it would be eugenic for various reasons.

I wonder why doesn't? Because wouldn't you think that abortion involves getting pregnant accidentally and and you'd expect that a person of low intelligence would do that. But then, on the other hand, I suppose the people that have very low intelligence will leave dealing with it so late that they won't be able to get an abortion, not legally anyway, because it's too late. Well, it seems that there's a couple of countervailing factors that come into play. You have higher religiosity among those with lower iq. Thus there may be more religious and cultural injunctions on abortions. It might also be that people with low Iq have less access for reasons of cognitive ergonomics, less agency, essentially, when it comes to getting abortions. So more likely to bring the child to term.

People with high iq might plan their pregnancies better. They they might, as a consequence, not get abortions, because the pregnancy is planned. I mean, Satoshi Kanazawa would argue that abortion should be, more common among high Iq people because it's an evolutionarily novel form of birth control. But we didn't find any evidence for that either. But because you can confect, you can sort of come up with these ad hoc hypotheses that could balance out the extremes in terms of high and low iq. Those would be older women getting pregnant later and be more likely to abort because they have a child with down syndrome or something. We did find that age was a predictor of abortion numbers that came out as being and and also income, but income completely independently of educational attainment and measured iq. So when you, when you control the effect of those things in the regression, you looked at educational attainment or iq with two different data sets...
