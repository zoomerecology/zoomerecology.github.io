## Fundamental Life History Tradeoffs

Activities that promote fitness ultimately do so by contributing to survival or reproduction (of self and/or related individuals). Organisms can channel resources into two main forms of investment: *somatic effort* and *reproductive effort*. Somatic effort consists of all those activities that increase an individual’s survival or its future reproductive potential. At a minimum, somatic effort comprises growth, body maintenance (e.g., tissue repair, immune function), and survival activities such as predator avoidance and predator defense. However, there is much more to somatic effort than staying alive and building a larger body. Developmental activities such as learning, exercise, and play contribute to increase reproductive potential through the accumulation of competence, knowledge, and skills. Social status and possession of external resources such as nests, territories, and wealth can also contribute massively to reproductive success. In total, somatic effort builds up and maintains stocks of *embodied capital*—investment in self that can be translated into future reproduction (Geary, 2002; Hill & Kaplan, 1999; Kaplan et al., 2000).

Reproductive effort directly channels resources into the replication of genes. This can be done in three distinct ways: through *mating effort* (finding and attracting mates, conceiving offspring), *parenting effort* (investing resources in already conceived offspring), and *nepotistic effort* (investing in other related individuals). Reproductive effort is thus a broad category and includes many activities that do not involve sex and mating—such as parents saving resources for their children and children helping their parents take care of younger siblings.

Because of limited time and energy, there are tradeoffs between somatic and reproductive effort, as well as between different components within each category. In addition, many if not most traits have contrasting effects on different components (e.g., heightened sexual motivation may increase mating effort at the expense of parenting effort) or on the same component at two different points in time (e.g., heightened HPA reactivity to stressors may promote survival in childhood but increase the risk of chronic diseases in adulthood). The many tradeoffs that result can be described and modeled at various levels of detail, from broad and general to narrow and specific (see Roff, 2002). Most research in life history theory has focused on three fundamental tradeoffs: current versus future reproduction, quality versus quantity of offspring, and mating versus parenting effort.

### CURRENT VERSUS FUTURE REPRODUCTION
The tradeoff between current and future reproduction is arguably the main allocation problem in life history evolution. At any point in time, energy can be devoted to reproduction in the present or spent in somatic effort, thus facilitating future opportunities to reproduce. On the one hand, trying to reproduce too early can be ineffective if one does not have the necessary resources and competitive skills. Moreover, reproduction is costly and prevents resources from being invested in embodied capital, thus lowering the chances of surviving and reproducing in the future (this is known as the “cost of reproduction”; Williams, 1966). On the other hand, waiting is also dangerous as it increases one’s chances of dying before leaving descendants (for an example of this tradeoff in humans, see Hayward et al., 2015). To solve this general problem, organisms typically have a juvenile phase during which reproductive effort is zero, and they stop growing when allocation to reproduction is likely to increases fitness more than growth. Even after maturity, adjusting reproductive timing remains a critical task for individuals and can have major effects on fitness.

### QUALITY VERSUS QUANTITY OF OFFSPRING
The second major tradeoff concerns a division within the resources allocated to current reproduction, namely allocation to increase offspring *quality* (e.g., size, health, survival, or competitive ability) versus allocation to increase offspring quantity. This tradeoff arises because parents have limited resources to invest in reproduction, and any additional offspring reduces the average investment per offspring in terms of parental care, provision of resources, and so on. Parental investment often plays an important role in offspring survival, but can also contribute to offspring’s somatic capital more broadly by increasing their health, skills, and status (see Kaplan, 1996). Quality–quantity tradeoffs are often difficult to demonstrate empirically, but there is evidence that they operate in human populations (e.g., Jones & Bliege Bird, 2014; Lawson et al., 2012; Meij et al., 2009).

### MATING VERSUS PARENTING EFFORT
In sexually reproducing species, finding and attracting mates takes time and may involve considerable energy expenditures (e.g., costly displays, competition with rivals) as well as exposure to danger (e.g., increased predation risk, sexually transmitted diseases). Individuals who already have offspring have the option of investing time and energy to increase their survival and quality. When mating effort and parental investment compete for time and resources, a tradeoff arises so that the opportunity of gaining additional mating must be weighed against a reduction in the fitness of existing offspring (Kokko & Jennions, 2008; Trivers, 1972). The mating–parenting tradeoff partly overlaps with the quality–quantity tradeoff, although offspring number can be regulated by many means other than mating—such as egg production, spontaneous abortion, or even infanticide. Also, the distinction between mating and parenting is not always a sharp one; when the ability to care and invest in offspring is a desirable trait in a mate, the same behaviors (e.g., protecting offspring, showing good provisioning skills) may contribute to both mating and parenting effort at the same time (Stiver & Alonzo, 2009).

## THE FAST–SLOW CONTINUUM

Life history strategies are often analyzed at the level of specific traits such as maturation timing and number of offspring. At the same time, variation in one trait is usually correlated to variation in other traits, giving rise to broader patterns of differences between species and individuals. An especially important pattern is that described by the fast–slow continuum of life history variation. The concept originates from the finding that the life histories of different species can be roughly arranged on a continuum, from “fast” (early maturation and reproduction, fast growth, small body size, short life span, large numbers of offspring, and low investment in offspring quality) to “slow” (late maturation and reproduction, slow growth, large body size, and long life span, with relatively few offspring and high parental investment in each) (Jeschke et al., 2008; Sæther, 1987; Promislow & Harvey, 1990; Figure 4.1). Among mammals, mice and voles are close to the fast end of the continuum, whereas elephants and whales are close to the slow end.

Some years ago, two well-known comparative studies cast doubts on the robustness of the fast–slow continuum and suggested that its apparent coherence may be an artifact of variation in body size. After size was controlled for, the continuum seemed to dissolve into multiple independent dimensions or end up being defined by a very different set of traits (Bielby et al., 2007; Jeschke & Kokko, 2009). However, both studies suffered from serious methodological problems; a later reanalysis of the data showed that, despite some meaningful differences between species—for example, offspring quantity is a “fast” trait in mammals and birds but not in fish—the fast–slow continuum remains a stable dimension of variation even controlling for differences in body size (Del Giudice, 2014b).

### THE FAST–SLOW CONTINUUM IN HUMANS
Among the defining features of the human life history are a long life span and a remarkably broad window for reproduction, with additional opportunities for nepotistic effort in old age (e.g., grandparenting) but also in childhood (helping). While reproduction can be distributed over an extended period of time, each offspring requires many years of investment by the mother and other family members. This constellation of factors suggests that, compared with most other species, variation on the human fast–slow continuum should be driven less by differences in current versus future reproduction and more by other tradeoffs, such as quality versus quantity and mating versus parenting. In particular, while the timing of sexual maturity (e.g., menarche in girls) and that of first birth obviously play a role in defining an individual’s life history trajectory, their net impact on total fertility is relatively small because reproductive effort can be allocated with considerable flexibility over a span of decades (Borgerhoff Mulder, 1989). The complexity of human mate choice, marriage practices, and social constraints on sexual behavior further complicates the relations between maturation and reproduction. While some societies maintain a strong temporal link between puberty and marriage in females, the association is often weakened by other factors—especially in industrialized countries, where nutritional factors have pushed down the age of puberty to unprecedented levels (Deardorff et al., 2005; Dunbar et al., 2008; Sandler et al., 1984; Udry & Cliquet, 1982). This applies even more strongly to men, who are not limited by pregnancy and lactation and can potentially have many children in a short time with different sexual partners. The reproductive rate of men is constrained by that of their female partners, so that their allocation in quality versus quantity depends to a larger extent on their investment in mating versus parenting (the dad/cad dichotomy discussed in Chapter 1).

On the face of it, the remarkable intensity of parental investment in our species should amplify the quality–quantity tradeoff; however, there are some complicating factors that make predictions less than straightforward. On the one hand, the balance between quality and quantity becomes even more critical when resources and wealth can be transferred across multiple generations. On the other hand, older children and adolescents are not just recipients of investment but can contribute to the family economy by taking care of younger siblings, foraging, and so on. If the cost of having additional children is partly repaid by the children’s help, the quality–quantity tradeoff is likely to become less stringent (Lawson & Borgerhoff Mulder, 2016). Intriguingly, the fact that human offspring can contribute to their parents’ reproduction while they remain in the family of origin implies that allocations between current and future reproduction may be partly driven by tradeoffs between mating effort (one’s own reproduction) and nepotistic effort (the parents’ reproduction).

In total, the correlates of human life history strategies should prominently include traits that modulate mating and parenting in addition to those that modulate reproductive timing and longevity. Against this background, there are reasons to predict systematic sex differences in the traits that define the fast–slow continuum. Fast strategies in males should be primarily associated with increased mating effort and risky competition. Fast strategies in females should be more tightly linked to early sexual maturation and childbearing, since decisions about reproductive timing are especially critical for women; however, these relations are not expected to be particularly strong for the reasons discussed earlier. Finally, women engaging in fast strategies should be less ready than men to forgo parental investment because maternal care is critical for infant survival. Instead, fast strategies in females should often correlate with behaviors directed at obtaining help and resources from others, including relatives and sexual partners (Chisholm, 1999a; Del Giudice, 2009a; Del Giudice et al., 2011; Harpending & Draper, 1988).

### MOTIVATION, DECISION-MAKING, AND SELF-REGULATION
In line with animal research on pace-of-life syndromes, human research has shown that impulsivity, risk-taking, and sensation seeking are systematically associated with fast life history traits such as early intercourse, early childbearing in females, unrestricted sociosexuality, larger numbers of sexual partners, reduced long-term mating orientation, and increased mortality. Future discounting and heightened mating competition reduce the benefits of reciprocal long-term relationships; in motivational terms, affiliation and reciprocity are downregulated, whereas status seeking and aggression are upregulated. The resulting behavioral pattern is marked by exploitative and socially antagonistic tendencies; these tendencies may be expressed in different forms in males and females, for example through physical versus relational aggression (see Belsky et al., 1991; Borowsky et al., 2009; Brezina et al., 2009; Chen & Vazsonyi, 2011; Copping et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2014a; Curry et al., 2008; Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo & Jacobs, 2010; Figueredo et al., 2004, 2005, 2007; Kahn et al., 2002; Kruger et al., 2008; Nettle, 2011b; Romer et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2009; White et al., 1994). Early maturation and precocious sexuality promote investment in current reproduction at the expense of future reproductive success (especially in females); at the same time, they accelerate the motivational shift toward mating and status competition, effectively curtailing the exploration and learning phase of childhood. From the standpoint of exploration–exploitation tradeoffs, this can be viewed as a reduction of exploration on a developmental scale, resulting in lower somatic capital in the form of knowledge and skills.

Disgust sensitivity is another dimension of individual differences with links to the fast–slow continuum. To begin, high disgust sensitivity is broadly associated with measures of risk aversion. Moral and sexual disgust correlate with higher agreeableness, conscientiousness, and honesty-humility; and sexual disgust specifically predicts restricted sociosexuality (Al-Shawaf et al., 2015; Sparks et al., 2018; Tybur et al., 2009, 2015; Tybur & de Vries, 2013). These findings suggest that the disgust system is implicated in the regulation of life history–related behaviors. In particular, sexual and moral disgust show the most consistent pattern of correlations with other indicators of slow strategies.

Romantic attachment styles have wide-ranging influences on sexuality, mating, and couple stability, but their relations with life history strategies are somewhat complex. Secure attachment styles are consistently associated with slow life history traits (e.g., Chisholm, 1999b; Chisholm et al., 2005; Del Giudice, 2009a). Avoidance predicts unrestricted sociosexuality, reduced long-term orientation, and low commitment to partners (Brennan & Shaver, 1995; Jackson & Kirkpatrick, 2007; Tempelhof & Allen, 2008). Given the central role of pair bonding in long-term parental investment, avoidant attachment—which, on average, is higher in men—can be generally interpreted as a mediator of reduced parenting effort. However, some inconsistent findings indicate that avoidance may capture multiple functional mechanisms. High levels of romantic avoidance are found both in people with very early sexual debut and in those who delay intercourse (Gentzler & Kerns, 2004); this suggests that, at least for some people, avoidant attachment may actually reflect a partial downregulation of the mating system, consistent with slower life history strategies. A related speculative hypothesis is that, in women, avoidance may sometimes increase as part of a broader response of reproductive suppression following intense relational stressors (Del Giudice, 2009a, 2011).

The core function of attachment anxiety is to maximize investment from partners and relatives, and high anxiety seems to be a common correlate of fast strategies in women (Del Giudice, 2009a). However, anxiety shows small and inconsistent relations with sociosexuality, again suggesting a degree of functional heterogeneity (Brennan & Shaver, 1995; Del Giudice, 2016a; Jackson & Kirkpatrick, 2007). Anxiously attached people find it very difficult to break up with their partners, and, when they do, they often leave open the option of getting back together. Accordingly, elevated anxiety does not predict relationship dissolution in longitudinal studies (Collins & Gillath, 2012; Henderson et al., 1997; Jang et al., 2002; Quirk et al., 2016; Stewart & Harkness, 2015). While attachment anxiety causes tension between partners and lowers their romantic satisfaction, it also contributes to keep them together, thus acting as a stabilizing factor as far as long-term investment is concerned. For this reason, a small to moderate amount of anxiety is probably not inconsistent with slow strategies, especially in women. To summarize, secure romantic attachment is consistently associated with slow strategies, but insecure strategies may play different functional roles at the two ends of the continuum. This invites caution in treating insecurity as an unambiguous marker of fast life history. A better approach is to focus on the temporal *stability* of romantic attachments, which is only in part a function of security (see Del Giudice, 2014a).

Some authors have proposed that individual differences in executive functions may be an important correlate of life history strategies in humans (e.g., Figueredo & Jacobs, 2010; Figueredo et al., 2006). This idea deserves closer examination. Disinhibition is a central component of impulsivity, but the cognitive laboratory tasks used to assess inhibition in studies of executive functions show only small to moderate correlations with impulsive behavior in real-life situations. Compared with self-reports of impulsivity, laboratory measures of inhibition are more strongly associated with IQ and less strongly associated with antisocial behavior, suggesting a confounding effect of general intelligence (Duckworth & Kern, 2011; White et al., 1994). While some findings indicate that cognitive inhibition tasks may predict life history–relevant outcomes such as faithfulness to romantic partners (e.g., Pronk et al., 2011), performance on these tasks is best regarded as a weak correlate of life history strategy. Another core executive function is flexibility/shifting. Flexibility is only weakly correlated with intelligence and shows inconsistent associations with impulsivity; in fact, high flexibility seems to be a negative predictor of the ability to suppress impulses and delay gratification (Hofmann et al., 2012; Miyake & Friedman, 2012; but see Fleming et al., 2016). These findings suggest that alternative life history strategies may involve a partial tradeoff between inhibition and flexibility; specifically, relatively low levels of executive flexibility may enable forms of proactive control based on persistence and long-term planning (Del Giudice, 2015a; Mittal et al., 2015).

### PERSONALITY FACTORS
At a higher level of abstraction, the behavioral correlates of life history strategies can be framed within the five-factor model of personality. Among the Big Five, agreeableness and conscientiousness show the most consistent pattern of associations with slow traits such as restricted sociosexuality, long-term mating orientation, couple stability, secure attachment to parents in infancy and romantic partners in adulthood, reduced sex drive, low impulsivity, and risk aversion across domains (e.g., Baams et al., 2014; Banai & Pavela, 2015; Bourdage et al., 2007; DeYoung, 2011; Holtzman & Strube, 2013; Jonason et al., 2013; Noftle & Shaver, 2006; Orzeck & Lung, 2005; Markey & Markey, 2007; Schmitt & Buss, 2000; Wiebe, 2004; Young et al., 2017; see Del Giudice, 2012b). Conscientiousness and (to a smaller extent) agreeableness are also the most reliable personality predictors of physical health and longevity; the contribution of neuroticism is mixed and may depend on the specific facets considered (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Chapman & Goldberg, 2011; Clarke & Robertson, 2005; Hill, Weiss et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2015; Jokela et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2007; Weiss & Costa, 2005; Weller & Tikir, 2011). The life history correlates of neuroticism are much less straightforward; for example, high neuroticism tends to predict increased short-term mating in women but reduced short-term mating in men, with much cross-cultural variation. There is also evidence that slow life history–related traits can be associated with social anxiety and insecurity, which is consistent with a general profile of risk aversion and behavioral inhibition (Schmitt & Shackelford, 2008; Sherman et al., 2013). As a first approximation, then, metatrait alpha can be treated as a broadband correlate of slow strategies, with the caveat that neuroticism may be elevated at both ends of the continuum (see also Del Giudice, 2014a).

A very different picture emerges for extraversion and openness, the two components of metatrait beta. From the standpoint of life history strategies, both are “hybrid” traits that include both fast and slow facets. In particular, the assertiveness and dominance facets of extraversion—but not the warmth and sociability facets—are associated with risk-taking and unrestricted sociosexuality (Lucas et al., 2000; MacDonald, 1995b). Accordingly, extraversion has been found to correlate with both short- and long-term mating orientation (Holtzman & Strube, 2013). Similarly, short-term mating orientation is associated with the imagination, aesthetics, and nonconformity facets of openness, but not with those that relate to intellectual curiosity (see Del Giudice, 2012b; Manson, 2017). As a result, metatrait beta is a poor indicator of fast strategy despite its overall positive correlations with impulsivity and risk-taking.

Outside the five-factor model, honesty-humility is another important correlate of slow life history strategies. Like agreeableness and conscientiousness, honesty-humility is associated with restricted sociosexuality, risk aversion, and future orientation (low time discounting; Ashton & Lee, 2008; Ashton et al., 2010; Bourdage et al., 2007; Manson, 2015). Conversely, dark triad traits correlate with unrestricted sociosexuality, aggression, reduced cooperation, and high time discounting (Jonason et al., 2010, 2015; Lee, Ashton et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2017). While many personality correlates of fast life histories are regarded as harmful and socially undesirable, it would be a mistake to idealize slow strategies by underplaying their biological and psychological costs. For example, conscientiousness and future orientation are mixed blessings: individuals high on these traits are inevitably less able to take advantage of unexpected opportunities in the present and may find it more difficult to adapt to changing or novel circumstances. High levels of self-control can lead to rigidity and conformity, and both agreeableness and honesty-humility expose people to the risk of being exploited (Ashton & Lee, 2008; Block & Block, 1980; de Vries et al., 2016; DeYoung et al., 2002; Dickman, 1990).

### COGNITIVE ABILITY
From a theoretical standpoint, there are no reasons to expect strong associations between life history strategies and general cognitive ability. The animal literature points to differences in cognitive style (e.g., *speed vs. accuracy*) rather than in overall efficiency, consistent with the idea that life history strategies primarily organize individual differences in function rather than functionality (Sih & Del Giudice, 2012). Still, there may be some minor sources of shared variation between general intelligence (g) and the fast–slow continuum. Brain development is a form of somatic investment; individuals who pursue faster strategies may invest less in maintenance mechanisms such as buffering of deleterious mutations and tissue repair. Also, high levels of stress and adversity in childhood tend to entrain faster strategies; to the extent that cognitive development is also affected by early stress, one can predict a correlation between faster strategies and lower intelligence. This effect is unlikely to be substantial considering that individual differences in g are largely under genetic control and respond only weakly to environmental factors, especially in adults. The results of human research support this prediction: correlations between general intelligence and composites of slow life history–related traits tend to be small, typically below .10 (Figueredo et al., 2014; Loehlin et al., 2015; Woodley, 2011; Woodley of Menie & Madison, 2015). However, the correlation may be stronger in populations exposed to extremely high levels of adversity and deprivation (e.g., prison inmates; Dunkel et al., 2014).

### NEUROBIOLOGICAL CORRELATES
The stress response system plays a critical role in coordinating life history allocations across organs and systems, but the relation between patterns of stress reactivity and life history strategies is not a simple one. According to the adaptive calibration model of individual differences in stress physiology (ACM; Del Giudice et al., 2011; Ellis & Del Giudice, 2014; Ellis et al., 2017), fast strategies can be associated with two distinct patterns of reactivity: a hyperreactive vigilant pattern characterized by anxiety and/or reactive aggression, and a hyporeactive unemotional pattern (possibly more common in men) with high levels of risk-taking and proactive aggression. Similarly, slow strategies can be associated with highly responsive sensitive patterns but also with moderately responsive, buffered patterns (Figure 4.2). While a life history perspective can shed light on the relations between stress reactivity and behavior, the very complexity of those relations implies that individual differences in stress physiology cannot be used as straightforward markers of life history strategy.

### MULTIPLE PROFILES WITHIN FAST AND SLOW STRATEGIES
In the basic model, fast strategies are associated with antagonistic, exploitative behaviors and overt dominance competition (particularly in males). However, an alternative way to channel mating effort is to invest in prestige competition and courtship with a combination of verbal skills, enhanced mentalizing, and creativity (specifically of the verbal and/or artistic kind; Del Giudice et al., 2010; Miller, 1999, 2000). In particular, successful courtship and interpersonal influence are promoted by mind-reading or cognitive empathy and not necessarily by affective empathy, which is the tendency to resonate with other people’s feelings on an emotional level (Slaughter et al., 2015; Wlodarski, 2015). The cognitive and behavioral strategies that arise from these alternative pathways can be labeled *antagonistic/exploitative* and *seductive/creative*. The antagonistic/exploitative and seductive/creative profiles define two separable regions in the behavioral space of fast strategies—variations on a common theme of high mating effort, impulsivity, and risk-taking (Figure 4.3). The key features of the seductive/creative profile are increased mentalizing, verbal ability, and creativity coupled with relatively low levels of aggression and physical dominance competition (Johnson et al., 2007). The personality factor most closely linked to this constellation of traits is openness to experience, particularly the imagination and aesthetics facets. At the level of brain functioning, upregulated mentalizing can be expected to correlate with elevated oxytocin, and possibly with heightened activation of the default mode network (Chapter 2).

![life-history stratergies](/images/life-history-stratergies.jpg)
**Figure 4.3.** *Key correlates of human life history strategies in the basic and extended model (see Table 4.1. for a more detailed list of traits). A = agreeableness. C = conscientiousness. H = honesty-humility. O = openness to experience.*

The extended model of fast strategies overcomes some limitations of the basic model by positing a range of partially differentiated strategies instead of a single constellation of life history–related traits. As an illustration, it is useful to consider how the two models deal with individual variation in the personality traits of the dark triad. The basic model regards the dark triad as a correlate of fast life histories, with no further differentiation between psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. By contrast, the extended model makes it possible to draw finer distinctions between these traits, which are moderately but not perfectly correlated with each other. Whereas psychopathic traits fall squarely in the domain of the antagonistic/exploitative profile, narcissistic traits are functionally closer to the seductive/creative profile. Within the triad, narcissism shows the smallest correlations with aggression and is associated with high levels of cognitive empathy. Narcissistic traits help people achieve leadership status in groups, and have been found to increase leadership effectiveness when they are present in moderate amounts (Grijalva, Harms et al., 2015; Jonason et al., 2013, 2015; Nagler et al., 2014; Ritter et al., 2011; Wai & Tiliopoulos, 2012). Machiavellianism seems to occupy an intermediate place between the two fast profiles described here. Somewhat counterintuitively, people with Machiavellian personalities tend to have relatively poor mind-reading abilities. At the same time, they are highly motivated to reason about other people’s states of mind and exploit them to their own advantage; they are also capable of rapidly and flexibly adjusting their behavior to changes in the social context (Bereczkei, 2015; Esperger & Bereczkei, 2012; Lyons et al., 2010). Another important dimension of personality that fits the seductive/creative profile is schizotypy, the tendency to experience low-level psychotic phenomena, such as hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Schizotypal personality traits are associated with artistic creativity and upregulated mentalizing; people high in schizotypy show increased success in short-term mating and other traits indicative of a fast strategy (Chapter 8; see also Del Giudice et al., 2010, 2014; Nettle, 2001, 2006a; Shaner et al., 2004).

Turning to slow strategies, the basic model focuses on traits that favor direct parental investment, such as affiliation, pair bonding, and secure attachment styles. All these traits imply a prosocial, nurturing attitude and are functionally associated with affective empathy. The resulting profile can be labeled as *prosocial/caregiving*; people with this constellation of traits can be expected to be sensitive partners and parents and score at the high end of agreeableness. However, direct caregiving is not the only route to successful parental investment. Especially for men, another option is to contribute mainly with status and resources—both of which can be acquired through mastery of technical skills, broadly defined (Del Giudice et al., 2010).

This male-typical reproductive strategy creates a niche for a *skilled/provisioning* profile in addition to the prosocial/caregiving one (Figure 4.3). The specific ecology of this profile changes the relative value of the traits associated with slow life histories in the basic model. Skilled/provisioning strategies clearly benefit from enhanced mechanistic cognition but do not require high levels of empathy, social skills, and artistic imagination; in fact, the latter may positively interfere with the development of technical proficiency. The expected cognitive profile is one of enhanced mechanistic reasoning and visuospatial abilities combined with reduced mentalizing. These are all important facets of autistic-like traits (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). Autistic-like traits comprise poor social and communication skills, heightened attention to details, restricted imagination, and a tendency to engage in highly focused, repetitive activities. While autistic-like traits are associated with increased risk for autism (Chapter 10), they are continuously distributed in the general population and do not imply the presence of a disorder. The extended life history model provides a broader context for the hypothesis that autistic-like traits have been selected as part of a high-investment, long-term mating strategy at the slow end of the continuum (Del Giudice et al., 2010, 2014a). The increasing diversification of social roles and technical skills sparked by the invention of agriculture is likely to have boosted the evolutionary benefits of skilled/provisioning strategies over the past 10,000 years (Del Giudice et al., 2010; Spikins, 2009). A related and intriguing possibility is that, while people with this profile are relatively ineffective in direct courtship, they may compensate by appealing to the mating preferences of parents (see Chapter 1).

Compared with the prosocial/caregiving profile, the expected personality correlates of skilled/provisioning strategies include low imagination (a facet of openness to experience) and moderate or low agreeableness, particularly in facets related to empathy and social compliance (for evidence of differential associations between facets of agreeableness and mentalizing skills, see Allen et al., 2017). At the neurobiological level, these traits should be associated with a downregulated oxytocinergic system (see Crespi, 2016a); dampened activation of the default mode network is another plausible correlate of this profile (Allen et al., 2017). From a developmental perspective, skilled/provisioning strategies should involve a long phase of sexual immaturity, which can be mediated by hormonal and/or motivational mechanisms (later puberty, delayed sexual interests and debut; see Forbes & Dahl, 2010). Protracted immaturity affords skilled/provisioning strategists ample time to engage in developmental exploration and accumulate specialized somatic capital that will become valuable later on. Accordingly, this profile might be associated with a combination of attachment avoidance and restricted sociosexuality, consistent with a partial suppression of the mating system.

Accordingly, this profile might be associated with a combination of attachment avoidance and restricted sociosexuality, consistent with a partial suppression of the mating system.

The nature of the traits that define the seductive/creative and skilled/provisioning profiles suggests that sex hormones may play a complex role in the development of these strategies. The seductive/creative profile is characterized by female-typical traits such as high investment in mentalizing, elevated oxytocin, and low physical aggression, which point to downregulation of androgen pathways and/or estrogen upregulation. However, the same traits coexist with a male-typical pattern of unrestricted sociosexuality and risk-taking, which are generally associated with elevated androgen levels. This paradoxical combination of motivational and cognitive features suggests a mixed neurobiological makeup, with elements of both up- and downregulation in different aspects of sex hormone signaling. A hypothetical example of how this could happen in practice would be the combination of (a) elevated androgen production and (b) suppressed responsivity to androgens in the brain mechanisms that mediate cognitive abilities such as mentalizing and verbal processing (e.g., through downregulation of androgen receptors). Alternatively, conversion of testosterone to estrogen within specific brain areas may produce a similar effect. Still another possibility is that mixed male-typical and female-typical features arise from alternating patterns of hormone secretion over time. For instance, low levels of prenatal androgens (which may have a stronger influence on cognitive processes that develop in childhood, including language and mentalizing) may be followed by elevated androgen levels during middle childhood and puberty (with stronger organizational and activational effects on mating- and competition-related systems). The specular scenarios apply to the skilled/provisioning profile, in which exaggerated male-typical cognitive traits (high mechanistic ability and visuospatial skills, poor mentalizing) coexist with a feminized motivational pattern of low mating effort and restricted sociosexuality.
