If Darson is a kind of mediator of mice social epistasis, what is its parallel, if any, in human social epistasis?

With Darsen, we're looking at a major Urinary Urinary pheromone protein that sort of signals social stress. This is a pheromone that is produced by mice with the nlgn3 knockouts, is the neurolygin gene three. You knock that out, these mice start producing this high relative molecular mass, major urinary pheromone protein they secrete in their urine and this signals social stress, when there isn't any social stress. Basically, this causes all sorts of maladaptive behavior to arise among the mice who are exposed to the Darcin, who start phenocopying these autisticlike traits. And we know that they do this because we've got the rna, which shows that the patterns of gene expression in the brain and the Papa Bellum region are altered. The Rna expression profiles change in contact after contact with this pheromone. So it's a it is a social epistasis pathway. The mutant mutation in one mice, or the knock knocked out gene rather, in one mouse, can actually affect patterns of gene expression of the brains of other mice through rna intermediaries. Which means we have a real social epistasis effect here, which is very interesting.

But in humans, it's culture. In humans, we don't go around peeing on things in order to mark our territory like mice do, or to signal social dominance. Most humans will, most humans will, basically, use cultural construction as a mechanism for competing. Humans will compete over the means of cultural construction. That's essentially mcdonald's dual process theory of culture, which I think is the best description we have of how culture is generated, how it evolves and how it maintains. And, if spiteful mutants are successful in competition over construction of culture by virtue of attaining elite positions, they can use that to basically shift the normative center of gravity into engender, behaviors in followers who are going to track the changes in the normative center of gravity. People with these followership traits, they can engender low fitness conditions among the followers like, for example, childlessness, or nihilism, or, you know, other other sorts of ideologies that are not necessarily conducive, or belief systems that are not conducive to to the maintenance of group fitness and group viability and intergroup conflict
