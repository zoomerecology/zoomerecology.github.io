I've got this theory about beards. Beards are very interesting evolutionarily, because beards go gray earlier than hair on the head. And i've seen people walking around in middle of the late 30s with gray beards and, you know, normal colored hair. And one possibility is that the beard is a costly signal in men. Because what it is, it not only does it artificially increase their apparent age beyond their actual age, therefore there is a cost to having it. It's like an antineopne signal, but it also honestly signals youth by virtue of the color. And if it can stay this color, basically for a long period of time, longer than it should do, then it indicates good genes for neotony. If it just turns Grey.
