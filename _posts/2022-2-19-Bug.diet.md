Bugs likely have much lower bioavailability than protein sources like eggs, milk and meat, which means muscle growth and tissue repair will suffer on a bug-based diet. Is that right?

I would honestly say, don't eat the bugs. Okay, yeah. Don't eat them. Don't live in the sewer pipe that's been converted into a pod for you. Don't eat the bugs. And don't go to work for amazon inside one of those cages that they're planning on putting their workers into. I don't know if you saw the patent on that, no, I didn't. The amazon cage basically you go into the cage, and the cage door closes and has like a mechanical claw, and you drive the cage around. And presumably if you want to leave the cage, you have to get your supervisor to let you out. So you actually get put into a mobile prison on wheels and driven around. And it's funny, because some spokes droid from amazon said, oh, the cage, it's just an idea. We're not going to really build them as we're keeping workers safe from being run over by robots, etc. And the workers could, in theory, leave or enter the cage as they chose, on their own. But then my question was, why is it the entry box to the cage is clearly on the outside of the cage, you know, the little coder? Why is it on the outside of the cage?

Yes, it does. It's gone too far. It's due for amazon to be broken.

That's it. The wagey cagey.
