How do you operationally define major innovations? 

Is there any way of quantifying what is a major versus minor innovation? Well, I would simply say that minor innovations are more likely to escape the notice of historians of science and technology, simply by virtue of the fact they're minor. Major innovations are conspicuous. As a result of being conspicuous, they are more likely to be independently noted by different historians of science and technology. So if you take a bunch of encyclopedias of science and technology, and you you count even wikipedia, and you just count up the number of major inventions by country listed in those encyclopedic works, and then you correlate those lists with one another, you find that these different encyclopedias converge very strongly. We're talking about correlations of about 0.89 in some cases. 

So this is convergent validity. This is how Gaulton said we should be in the business of measuring genius and eminence. He argued, genius is something that you only know about it once it's happened. It's almost impossible to detect it beforehand. Turman found this out the hard way. David Labinsky and camilla benbow have found this out the hard way. There are no geniuses in any of their data sets, like simpy or the terminite data set from the 1920s. They're smart kids, but they're not geniuses. As a matter of fact, two geniuses were left out of of turman's data set, uh Luis Agus, Louis Alvarez, who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry, and William Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize in physics. Neither of them made the cutoff for iq, funnily enough, in term and study. So these attempts to try and identify the determinants of genius and then identify the flourishing of genius as a life course, like checking off courses of these individuals, doesn't work.

You can only only detect the geniuses based on their actual impacts. And where you measure their impacts is to look at how much agreement there is among scientists and historians in terms of who and what constitutes a major breakthrough within a particular field. And as a result of that, you get very high convergence among these different bibliographies. And you can just track out, across time the frequencies of major innovations, or major innovators in the case of geniuses. And you see this distinctive pattern where it increases per capita up until about the 1870s, and then it crashes. It differs for different fields but it generally is a rule of thumb. The peaks are in the 19th century, and then we're in a sort of a declining phase, a sort of dysgenic phase.
