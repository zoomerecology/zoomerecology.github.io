Do you think taking psychedelics could benefit your research? 

No, my view is is that a lot of these psychedelics are extraordinarily dangerous in ways that we don't even understand. So, I would, I would say that for your both your physical and, shall we say, your spiritual wellbeing, these things are best avoided.
