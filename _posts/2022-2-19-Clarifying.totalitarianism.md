Is the futuritarian or based?

I i see no reason why it can't be both. It could be totalitarian. I i think it will beat us out there. And, yeah, and and it could be totalitarian and based. Do you have any thing to add to that?

Well, I mean, totalitarianism, it just means that the state basically, uh, in some way involves itself in all forms of interpersonal interaction. Really the idea, I suppose that's not strictly true. The original definition of totalitarianism was the idea that the state is total so all, all sort of interactions between individuals have to be, you know, looked at in the context of whether they benefit the state or not. And this was kind of the basis of fascism under Mussolini. I think he coined the term.

But totalitarianism today generally is taken to imply monadism, which is a different thing. So the idea of a monadic state which actually actively involves itself in curbing individual liberties in an effort to promote, in an effort to sort of promote, uh, things which are to its benefit, but to the detriment of its components.

I don't want to live in a future like that. I mean, I don't mind living in a future in which people are more nationalistic, but I don't really want to live in a future in which people have to have to basically accept that everybody have to run every decision they make about what they do through the state in order to get it checked off. I don't think that's, that's never something that will take root in this country. That's, you know, North Korea, basically. It's like an asian thing.

We have a history of freedom and genius. That's the nature...

We do. And that's something i, I'm quite proud of, and, tradition I wish to maintain in this country. You have to have a certain freedom to have genius, and genius manifests in a certain degree of freedom as well. Yes. So I can't see that happening. Could it be based, I i think the trend, this writing is on the wall. Things are clearly moving in that direction. It's just more based direction.
