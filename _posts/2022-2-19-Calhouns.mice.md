I thought that John B. Calhoun's mice had lots of epigenetic changes, transsexualism with the behavioral sink?

So the answer to that is, yes. Colvin's mice almost certainly did have lots of epigenetic and also genetic changes, because I'm convinced his beautiful ones were Nlgn3 minus mutants. They seem to have pretty much the same phenotype that we get with Nlg and when we knock out Nlgn3, it's neurolign e3. Um, so what you probably had was a small number of mutants which arose through just the normal process of mutation accumulation, under relaxed, uh, negative selection. Um, and this would have been coupled with the the negative effects of these mutations on the social epistasis, ie, the development of these other mice. These other mice coming into contact with them would have developed these, you know, phenocopte these abnormal sort of behaviors. Which they seem to do under these smaller, sort of more controlled conditions that we can get in the laboratory. When you career the mutants with the nonmutants, you can induce all these weird behaviors. And the nonmutants. So I suspect they were. Cole hoon himself didn't think mutations were causing the change. He his behavioral sync model was essentially based on the idea of all driven by Paul Ehrlich type population bomb. This stuff about overcrowding, all the stress and damage it does, but that, that doesn't really explain why it is that, uh. But when the colony collapsed completely, uh, there was no recovery. There was no, no sort of residual mice there that ended up recovering. This was some kind of mutational meltdown that was going on, what ecologists call an extinction vortex, an extinction vortex opened up here, driven by social epistasis and this total colony, basically. So, that's what I think is going on there. I think you're right. There would have been these epigenetic changes. And if we'd have all the tools today that we had back then, we'd have been able to get to the bottom of it with this wonderful experimental design. Okay,
