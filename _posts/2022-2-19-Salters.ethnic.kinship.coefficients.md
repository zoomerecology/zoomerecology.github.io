The way Frank Salter calculates these, these ethnic kinship coefficients, is he looks at the the costs, essentially, to cooperation between individuals of different ancestral groups, in terms of the degree to which you reduce the aggregate fitness of your group through rendering aid to members of another group. And this is based on the idea that um that it's possible to to quantify cooperative benefits within an ethnic grouping in terms not of recent common ancestry, but in terms of a relatively different distance between two randomly selected members of an ethnic group, and randomly selected members of a one ethnic group versus another ethnic group. And the idea is that when you look at the relative coefficient of relatedness among two randomly selected members of a particular ethnic group relative to another group, depending on the genetic distance between those groups, that increases the relative proximity in terms of the payoff to cooperation of those two randomly selected members of that same ethnic group. 

So for example, if you take two british people, and you have, they could just be random british people, and they cooperate with each other in repulsing, say, danes. They work together against demons. You take the genetic distance between danes and british people, you can show that those two randomly selected british people, in terms of the fitness payoff to cooperation, those individuals would be paying, it would be generating a fitness payoff to the group. It would be equivalent to them having a very high relative level of genetic relatedness, like second cousin of something. So this would be the equivalent of having second cousins cooperating against other people, in terms of a relative fitness payoff?

And I think he calculated that it was, it was thousands, it had to be thousands and thousands of danes that would that would come to Britain for it to be the equivalent of a losing one brit.
